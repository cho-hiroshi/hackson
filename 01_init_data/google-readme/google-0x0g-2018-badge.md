## About ##

This is the electronic badge distributed at 0x0G, Google's annual event at
DEF CON/Black Hat.  This badge features a PIC microcontroller driving a ring of
LEDs with communication over infrared.

Included are circuit design files and firmware source.  Both are licensed under

This is not an officially supported Google product.  This is a one-time release,
do not expect updates even if it turns out we have bugs.
