The ORFConverter application converts ORF raw photo files from Olympus
OMD E-M10 Mark II cameras to ones tagged as being from the earlier
OMD E-M10 model to make the files readable by certain applications that
may not otherwise recognize ORF files from the newer camera model. It does
so by finding and overwriting the EXIF camera model tag.

This program implements a Windows form-based GUI, and has been verified to
work with Windows versions 7 through 10, though it may (or may not) be
compatible with other versions of Windows.

The application is written in C# and the project was created and built using
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015.
