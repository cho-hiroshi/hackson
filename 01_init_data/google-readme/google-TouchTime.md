This is an Android Wear smart watch application that lets you tell the
time by touch. It is designed to be useful for the vision-impaired and
people who want to tell the time surreptitiously.

As you slide your finger around the screen the watch will vibrate when
you touch one of the virtual hands. The vibration pattern depends on
the hand touched: continual vibration for the hour hand, pulsing
vibration for the minute hand, and a long-short pulsing pattern if the
hands are on top of each other.

This package also includes a smartphone version of the software,
allowing you to test the application without a smart watch.
