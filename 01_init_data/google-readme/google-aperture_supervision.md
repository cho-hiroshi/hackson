This is not an official Google product.


Running this code requires the dataset from [Srinivasan 2017](https://github.com/pratulsrinivasan/Local_Light_Field_Synthesis)


This code is not quite the same as what was used in the paper, as the bilateral solver implementation used in the paper is not included in this open source release. Comments in the code indicate where the solver used to be.
