# Bazel Common Libraries

This repository contains assorted common functionality for Google's open-source
libraries that are built with [`bazel`]. It is an experimental project and none
of the APIs/target names are fixed/guaranteed to remain. You are welcome to use
it and offer feedback at your own risk.

This is not an official Google product.
