# CertToStore

CertToStore is a Multi-Platform package that allows you to work with x509
certificates on Linux and the certificate store on Windows.

[TOC]

## Why CertToStore?

CertToStore was created to solve some specific problems when working with
certificates using Go. Ever wanted to create public/private key
pairs using the TPM or create certificate requests using TPM backed keys?
Both are possible using CertToStore on Windows. Linux support is also planned.

__Native Certificate Store Access without the prompts__
Certificate storage in CertToStore under Windows uses the certificate
store by using native Windows calls. By using native functionality, you won't
see the all to common "do you want to import this certificate?" when installing
certificates using certtostore.

Additionally, you can lookup and use existing certificates with their private
keys through CNG, regardless of how they were issued (TPM or Software backed).

__Built-in support for Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG)__
CertToStore under Windows was built from the ground up to use Microsoft's
Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG). This grants certificates generated,
requested, and stored using CertToStore the ability to use your computer's TPM
to safely store private key material safely.

__Compatibile with packages that use x509.Certificate__
x509 compatible certs means that you can use private keys and certificates
generated by CertToStore with just about anything else in Go that works with
certificates. Want to generate certificate requests using the TPM, and send them
to your own third-party CA? Have a Go based web server that you want to use with
a TPM backed certificate? Sure thing.
