We often find recurring patterns when handling asynchronous logic with promises, such as an HTTP endpoint that paginates and gives you a URL pointer to the next available dataset.

`Chained Promise` provides an extended Promise class that you can use to easily abstract out recurring patterns. See jsdocs for more detailed explanations.

## Example

Suppose we are querying Wikipedia API to get the list of all linked pages from "Plato" page:

```javascript
const apiPoint = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?" +
  "action=query&prop=links&format=json&plnamespace=0&titles=Plato&pllimit=500";
```

With `fetch` we can turn the end point into a promise. Then we can use `ChainedPromise` to extend the promise:

```javascript
import ChainedPromise from "chained-promise";

ChainedPromise.from(fetch(apiPoint))
```

First thing we want to do is to parse the resulting JSON:

```javascript
  .flatMap((res) => res.json())
```

Now we have a promise that resolves into a JS object. Next we need to map the result into the format that `ChainedPromise` is expecting.

```javascript
  .map((v) => {
    return {
      data: v.query.pages,
      next: v.continue ?
          fetch(apiPoint + '&plcontinue=' + encodeURIComponent(v.continue.plcontinue)) :
          {[ChainedPromise.DONE]: 'done fetching links from Plato page'}
    };
  })
```

The `data` field contains the material content of the value, while the `next` field contains either the promise to the next batch of data, or `{[ChainedPromise.DONE]: lastNode}` which `ChainedPromise` recognizes to be the terminal node.

Now that the chaining of the value has been configured, we can work on the series of data.

```javascript
  .forEach((v) => {
    Object.keys(v.data).forEach((pageId) => {
      v.data[pageId].links.forEach((link) => {
        console.log(link.title);
      });
    });
  })
```

This executes the given callback function, and the result itself is a promise that resolves into the value of the terminal node when it reaches the end.

See [the example project](examples/wikipedia-list-links) for the full example code. Also see jsdoc to [ChainedPromise.ts](src/ChainedPromise.ts) for more explanation of other functions such as `flatMap`.
