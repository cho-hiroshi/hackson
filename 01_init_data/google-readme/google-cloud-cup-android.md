It is an Android application, designed to be built using Android Studio.
It relies on the [Firebase Android SDK](https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/api/) to provide backend and real-time features.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
