# Dart APIs for Google Apps Script

This is not an official Google product. It is not supported by the Dart team.

This package is still in an experimental state.

A library to write Google Apps Script.

This library has been written on a per-need basis. As such it is missing lots
of useful functionality that I just hadn't needed yet. Until the API coverage
is nearing completeness I recommend to checkout the GIT repository during
development and to use this library with a `path` directive, adding the missing
functions when they are encountered.

Consider contributing your changes back to the original repository.
