# encrypted-bigquery-client

The encrypted BigQuery client is an experimental extension of the
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) client. It
offers client-side encryption for a subset of query types. Currently
it is implemented in Python.

Sample data and query examples is available in our [tutorial](tutorial.md).
