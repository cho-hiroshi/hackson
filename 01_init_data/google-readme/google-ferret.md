To use Ferret:

Collect some logs using the logger. These will write to a file called ALoggerLog.txt on the device in the /data/data/com.google.research.ic.alogger directory.

Place log files (as many as you like) in the directory ferret/analyzer/logs.

Hook up an Android device with the logger installed to your desktop/laptop.

Run AppMain in the ferret-analyzer project in Eclipse (other IDEs not supported yet).

Point your browser to ferret/analyzer/webui/index.html.

Click "record" and enter an interaction sequence, then press "search." 

Enjoy the results!
