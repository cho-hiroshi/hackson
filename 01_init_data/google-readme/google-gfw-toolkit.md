## Deprecation Notice

Users of gfw-toolkit,

The team at Google responsible for gfw-toolkit want to provide you with a 30 day notice that the repository [google/gfw-toolkit](https://github.com/google/gfw-toolkit) will be deprecated on 11/14/16.

### What does this mean?
The github project will be deprecated and Google will discontinue support for gfw-toolkit.

### Why are you doing this?
The reason Google first created these tools was to address a need when there were limited alternatives in the market. Today there are options available that are better supported and in many cases provide an improved experience.

### What are the alternative options?
We recommend switching to use [Google Apps Manager](https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM) as the functionality provided by gfw-toolkit is well supported by Google Apps Manager and can offer an improved benefit over it.

Here's an [example on key management with GAM](https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki/SecurityExamples#oauth-tokens)

We thank you for your support and use of the tool, we hope it was useful!
