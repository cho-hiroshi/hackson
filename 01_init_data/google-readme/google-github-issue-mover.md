## How to use

You can copy paste full GitHub URLs. For instance you can copy paste

`https://github.com/google/github-issue-mover/issues/1`

into the "Issue to Move" text field. It will get automatically transformed to the _short_ GitHub URL:

`google/github-issue-mover#1`

The tool will extract some information about the issue if it's accessible to your user:

You can do the same for the "Destination Repo" text field and copy paste:

`https://github.com/nicolasgarnier/drive-music-player`

It will get automatically transformed to the _short_ GitHub URL for repos:

`nicolasgarnier/drive-music-player`

and some information will get extracted as well:

<img width="300px" src="https://github.com/google/github-issue-mover/raw/master/README_assets/repo.png">

Once existing issue and repo have been set you can start the move process:

<img width="300px" src="https://github.com/google/github-issue-mover/raw/master/README_assets/move.png">

This will create a new issue which is a copy of the original one, with mentions of every users who commented on the bug. The two issues will also references themselves:
