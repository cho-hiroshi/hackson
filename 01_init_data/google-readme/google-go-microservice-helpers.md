# Go-Microservice-Helpers

**This is not an official Google product**

A collection of handy snippets that simplify creation of GRPC servers and
clients. The provided helpers allow to create grpc endpoints with zipkin
distributed tracing pre-configured; spawn http servers that serve both grpc and
common http traffic; simplify golang crypto primitives to load EC keys.
