This project is [Gojiraw](http://google.github.io/gojiraw/) -- a convenient abbreviation of "GO JIffy-fast
RAW-draw". Gojiraw is a library and demo program for a deferred (i.e.
display-list based) GPU-accelerated 2D rendering system. The drawing
primitives (a work in progress) are inspired by the [Plan9 raster
drawing library](https://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man3/draw.html) and the [Blink](http://www.chromium.org/blink) drawing interface.
