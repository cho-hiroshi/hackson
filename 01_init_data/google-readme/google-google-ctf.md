# Google CTF

This repository lists most of the challenges used in the Google CTF 2017. The missing challenges are not ready to be open-sourced, or contain third-party code.

**IMPORTANT** - The code in the 2017 and 2018 folders has unfixed security vulnerabilities. These are there on purpose, and running these on real production infrastructure is not safe.
