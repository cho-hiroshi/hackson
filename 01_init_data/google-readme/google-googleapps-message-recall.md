## Deprecation Notice

Users of message-recall,

The team at Google responsible for the message-recall want to provide you with a 30 day notice that the repository [google/googleapps-message-recall](https://github.com/google/googleapps-message-recall) will be deprecated on 11/14/16.

### What does this mean?
The github project will be deprecated and Google will discontinue support for message-recall.

### Why are you doing this?
The reason Google first created these tools was to address a need when there were limited alternatives in the market. Today there are options available that are better supported and in many cases provide an improved experience.

### What are the alternative options?
We recommend switching to use [Google Apps Manager](https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM) as the functionality provided by message-recall is well supported by Google Apps Manager and can offer an improved benefit over it.

For example:

    ./gam all users delete messages query rfc822msgid:asfdfdf@example.com doit max_to_delete 1

We thank you for your support and use of the tool, we hope it was useful!
