# gtd-txt: Getting Things Done in plain text

gtd-txt is a task manager designed for use with David Allen's Getting Things
Done methodology. It's similar in spirit to the [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/)
system, but it uses one file per project, instead of one line per action. This
allows you to easily group notes alongside projects and actions.

This is not an official Google product.
