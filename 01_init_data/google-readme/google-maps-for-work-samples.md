This repository contains samples, demos and tools relating to the
Google Maps APIs and related enterprise products, like Google Maps
Engine.

The samples directory contains simple samples that show a single
concept.

The demos directory shows some more complex examples, and usually
combines the use of a concept or two.

The tools contain different tools that both show how to do some thing,
but also is a useful tool that you can use e.g. for debugging.

Each directory is split into a sub-directory based on the product it
applies to.
