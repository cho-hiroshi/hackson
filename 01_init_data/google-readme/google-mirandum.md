# mirandum

This is a project designed to allow for the running of a website which will
deliver information about account changes while livestreaming; it uses
Google's YouTube, Gmail, and Live Streaming  APIs (and eventually others)
to access information about your account, and provide a web UI for presenting
this information.

This is an alternative to software like Stream Warrior/tnotify.


The intent is to allow an extensible way to add additional alerting into this
application for additional features, e.g. highlighting on hotwords in
livestream chat, connecting to twitter, connecting to other features of
videos, etc.

This tool is designed to replace StreamWarrior for some of its uses, but
may still be useful with a combination of other tools.
