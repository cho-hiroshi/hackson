## Morphie : Data Analysis with Graphs ##

Morphie is a tool that uses graphs to analyze and summarize the content of
formatted input data in JSON or CSV format. The primary use case is to analyze
supertimelines generated by [Plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso),
which is an open source, forensic analysis tool . Morphie currently parses
supertimelines and constructs labeled graphs from them. There is support for
visualization using [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

### Disclaimers ###

* Morphie is not an official Google product.

* Development is at an early stage.

### About the name ###

Morphie uses graph transformations to reduce the amount of structure and
complexity in a graph constructed from log data. It morphs graphs and more
precisely, the relationships between the graphs before and after a
transformation are given by a kind of homomorphism.


## System Requirements ##

In order to build, the following packages must be available in the system.
* The [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system, version 2.8.12 or higher.
* The [Google Protocol Buffer compiler](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/v2.6.1), version 2.6.1 or higher.
  * Some Debian repositories are still at version 2.5.0, in which case, the
    compiler can be installed from GitHub.
  * The build currently requires a system-wide install.
  * If you system has multiple versions, check that `protoc` resolves to the
    2.6.1 version.
* The [Boost C++ libraries](http://www.boost.org/).
 * The [Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html).
 * The [Boost String Algorithms Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/string_algo.html).
 * [Boost Regex](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html), version 1.43.0 or higher.

Network access is required to build because the following packages will be
downloaded.
* The [Google Test libraries](https://github.com/google/googletest).
* The [JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) JSON parser.
* The [gflags package](https://github.com/gflags/gflags).
([An explanation](https://github.com/gflags/gflags#25-january-2012)
  of how Google flags became gflags).

## Installation ##

To install, run the following commands:

```
  # Get the code from GitHub
  git clone git@github.com:google/morphie.git
  # Create a directory in which CMake can do its magic
  cd morphie
  mkdir build
  # Create a directory in which CMake can do its magic
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
```
