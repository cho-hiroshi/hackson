# Network Mapper

A collection of tools for network mapping. It is designed specially for situations where there is a single central node, and a set of branches off of it which can each have various properties (typically size and color).

The subdirectory 'networkx-d3-v2' contains the code that uses D3 to visualise the network graph.

A live example of an earlier version of this code was used by Al-Jazeera to track defections from the Syrian regmine to the revolutionary opposition that started in 2009 is available here:
