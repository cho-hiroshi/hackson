# Overview

pam-cryptsetup provides a PAM module that allows LUKS-based disk encryption passwords to be
kept in sync with account passwords automatically based on factors like if the user has
decypted the disk successfully previously.

# Module Configuration
When adding this module to an authentication stack, it is recommended to use either the '[default=ignore]' or 'optional' flags and to place the entry for the module at the very end of the PAM config file sequence, as one probably doesn't want authentication of a user hinging on a module that doesn't provide any.

## Arguments:
* `crypt_name=<container>` (Required): Name of encrypted /dev/mapper based container to probe.
* `debug=<state>`: If set to 'true', provide additional execution details via pam_syslog. Otherwise behavior is not modified.

## Examples:
For an encrypted device at /dev/mapper/rootdev_crypt:
```
auth [default=ignore] pam_cryptsetup.so crypt_name=rootdev_crypt
```
Square brackets ([ and ]) can be used for device names with spaces:
```
auth [default=ignore] pam_cryptsetup.so [crypt_name=my special device]
```
As an alternative to the standard authentication mode (where the module runs at every auth) the module can instead be used in password mode, and will run only when a user account password is set via the passwd command:
```
password [default=ignore] pam_cryptsetup.so crypt_name=rootdev_crypt
```

# Crypt Slot Cache
All user information, such as which (if any) slot was most recently unlocked with their login password, is recoded in /var/cache/libpam-cryptsetup as a GLib string array.
The default format, before any unlocking has happened, is as follows:
```
['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']
```
where each string associates with one of the 8 LUKS slots (numbered 0-7) available. Once a user's password has sucessfully unlocked a slot on the disk, their username is added to the string associated with the number slot unlocked.

For example, if we had a user "kathy" unlock slot 3, the cache would be updated as follows:
```
['', '', '', 'kathy', '', '', '', '']
```
Next time kathy authenticates, this info will be used to determine the appropriate action for the module to take.

# Operation
During authentication, the module takes the following information into account:
* Username
* Password
* Cache entries
* Crypt slots

Once all available information is gathered, the action taken is decided by the following logic:

Authentication mode:

* No action if:
  * User is not recorded in-cache, and password does not unlock any slot
  * User is recorded in-cache, and password unlocks the associated slot
* Update disk slot if:
  * User is recorded in-cache, and password does not unlock recorded slot
* Update cache if:
  * User is recorded in-cache, and password unlocks different slot than the one recorded
  * User is not recorded in-cache, and password unlocks a slot

Password mode:

* No action if:
  * Old password does not unlock a slot
* Update disk if:
  * Old password unlocks a slot
* ADDITIONALLY update cache if:
  * User entry exists in a different cache slot compared to new crypt slot

Note: While password mode will interact with the cache in some cases, it is not meant to be used in addition to authentication mode, and such usage is untested and considered unsupported at this time; you have been warned!
