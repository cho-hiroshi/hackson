This project is intended for educational use. It demonstrates the use of the Google Web Toolkit in combination with AppEngine and the Picasa GData API. Using these technologies this application enables users to browse public albums and photos of Picasa users. It has a UI that adapts dynamically to the browser's size. In addition it gives users the ability to comment on photos. These comments can be seen by other users.

For learning purposes, the app is available in two versions:

 * The complete application: You can either download it from the SVN repository of this project or from the download list, where the Eclipse project is available in a ZIP file.
 * A partial application: This is a working version that is incomplete. Comments throughout the code show what's missing. You can download this version as zipped Eclipse project from the download section of this project where it is names 'task1'.

This is how the running application looks like:
