Power Traces

This is a set of power trace measurements taken from a secure
microcontroller performing AES.

This dataset is blind. There are different countermeasures enabled and
disabled in each trace series. As this is a research dataset, please
contact the repository maintainer for additional information.

NOTE: These data sets are large; it is necessary to use "git lfs"
to manage them on GitHub. Installation instructions are here:
