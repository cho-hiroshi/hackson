RenderTiming plugin for Unity
=============================

This plugin employs the OpenGL timer query extension
(`GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query`) to provide accurate GPU time measurements
in real-time to apps made with the Unity game engine.  Notably
this works on mobile devices and has virtually no overhead.

Typical use cases include:
   * adding GPU frame time to an app's real-time debug overlay
   * getting instant, in-app feedback on coding changes which affect rendering,
     as well as visibility into performance regressions and problematic views
   * automated performance testing

Caveats
-------
   * **only Android is supported** (adding other GL platforms is straightforward)
   * quality varies among mobile implementations of GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query.
     **Notably, some GPU's (e.g. Mali) don't provide a useful measurement
     at all.**
   * only GLES3 graphics API is supported, not GLES2 or Vulkan
     (adding GLES2 support is straightforward)
   * plugin does not verify GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query existence yet

Unity versions tested: 5.4 and 5.6

GPU's tested: Snapdragon 821 (Adreno 530), Snapdragon 835 (Adreno 540)

Quick start
-----------
1. download the latest [RenderTiming Unity package](../../releases/latest/) and
import it into your Unity project
2. add the RenderTiming component to a suitable singleton object in your scene
3. reference `RenderTiming.instance.deltaTime` from your in-app debug
overlay, etc.

By default it will log GPU time to console once per second.  Disable via
component's "Log Timing" field in the inspector.

It will measure GPU time from the end of Update until the end of frame
rendering.  (I.e. encompassing both eyes for VR stereo case.)
See [`RenderTiming.cs`](RenderTiming/Assets/RenderTiming/RenderTiming.cs)
source for additional caveats.
