`WindowTester Pro` is a UI test generation tool for testing [SWT](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/) and `Swing Java` applications. `WindowTester Pro` eliminates the need to manually create test cases to test GUIs by automating the process of GUI testing. Using `WindowTester Pro`, developers can easily create tests for every GUI they create. The tests generated by `WindowTester Pro` are standard [JUnit](http://junit.org/) tests thus they can be run within your [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) environment or they can be automated to run using [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). Typically, tests are recorded on projects within your `Eclipse` environment.
