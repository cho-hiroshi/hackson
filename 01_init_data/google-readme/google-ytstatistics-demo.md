Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/ytstatistics-demo

This project is intended for educational use. It demonstrates the use of the [YouTube GData API](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html), the [Google Visualization API](http://code.google.com/apis/charttools/), [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) and [App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/). Using these technologies this application enables users to view statistics for a YouTube user's video stream.

For learning purposes, the app is available in two versions:

* The complete application: You can either download it from the SVN repository of this project or from the download list, where the Eclipse project is available as a ZIP file.
* A partial application: This is a working version that is incomplete. Comments throughout the code show what's missing. You can download this version as a zipped Eclipse project from the download section of this project where it is named 'task1'.

This is how the running application looks like:
