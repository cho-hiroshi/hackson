# What is Zarathustra?

The code in this repository is the core of Zarathustra, an experimental system
to detect web-inject malware by observing the changes injected in web pages.
The paper included in the repository provides further details on the
architecture and the goals of this code.

# A note on code quality
By no means the code in this repository should be considered of "production" quality:
while it passes unit tests, it was only meant to support the academic research
detailed in the paper; it is being released manly as a support for future work
in the field, because we should stop reinventing the wheel.
