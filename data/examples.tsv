google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	  _beta_: be ready for breaking API changes builder class
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	Builders are great when you have a constructor or method withmany parameters
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	They are even helpful when you have two or more arguments ofthe same type, since the order is easy to mix up.Builders are usually hard to write
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	You will probably need around 4 lines forevery field, and if it's an inner class, it makes the file long and cumbersometo navigate
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	This discourages many people from writing builders, and thosepeople give up and learn to live with brittle, and hard-to-read code
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	If youwant to add multiple setters for a field  common for lists that may have add andaddAll , your builder will quickly become a chore to write and a burden toCallBuilder changes that
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	To use it, you can simply write the method orconstructor as you normally would, but add the @CallBuilder annotation:that are of a certain type
google-readmegoogle-CallBuilder.md	CallBuilder	This can make the API more natural and look morelike a manually-written builder:

google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	DirectX Shader Compiler	 ! Build status  The DirectX Shader Compiler project includes a compiler and related tools used to compile High-Level Shader Language  HLSL  programs into DirectX Intermediate Language  DXIL  representation
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	DirectX Shader Compiler	Applications that make use of DirectX for graphics, games, and computation can use it to generate shader programs.For more information, see the  Wiki 
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Features and Goals	The starting point of the project is a fork of the  LLVM  and  Clang  projects, modified to accept HLSL and emit a validated container that can be consumed by GPU drivers.At the moment, the DirectX HLSL Compiler provides the following components:The goal of the project is to allow the broader community of shader developers to contribute to the language and representation of shader programs, maintaining the principles of compatibility and supportability for the platform
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Features and Goals	It's currently in active development across two axes: language evolution  with no impact to DXIL representation , and surfacing hardware capabilities  with impact to DXIL, and thus requiring coordination with GPU implementations .
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	SPIR-V CodeGen	As an example of community contribution, this project can also target the  SPIR-V  intermediate representation
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	SPIR-V CodeGen	Please see the  doc  docs/SPIR-V.rst  for how HLSL features are mapped to SPIR-V, and the  wiki  page for how to build, use, and contribute to the SPIR-V CodeGen.
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Building Sources	Note: Instead of building manually, you can download the artifacts built by Appveyor for the latest master branch at  here Before you build, you will need to have some additional software installed
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Building Sources	This is the most straightforward pathTests are built using the TAEF framework
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Building Sources	Unless you have the Windows Driver Kit installed, you should run the script at utils\hct\hctgettaef.py from your build environment before you start building to download and unzip it as an external dependency
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Building Sources	You should only need to do this once.To build, run this command on the HLSL Console.You can also clean, build and run tests with this command.To see a list of additional commands available, run hcthelp
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Running Tests	To run tests, open the HLSL Console and run this command after a successful build.Some tests will run shaders and verify their behavior
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Running Tests	These tests also involve a driver that can run these execute these shaders
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Running Tests	See the next section on how this should be currently set up.
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Running Shaders	To run shaders compiled as DXIL, you will need support from the operating system as well as from the driver for your graphics adapter
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Running Shaders	Windows 10 Creators Update is the first version to support DXIL shaders
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Running Shaders	See the  Wiki  for information on using experimental support or the software adapter.
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	Hardware Support	Hardware GPU support for DXIL is provided by the following vendors:
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	NVIDIA	NVIDIA's r396 drivers  r397.64 and later  provide release mode support for DXIL1.1 and Shader Model 6.1 on Win10 1709 and later, and experimental mode supportfor DXIL 1.2 and Shader Model 6.2 on Win10 1803 and later
google-readmegoogle-DirectXShaderCompiler.md	NVIDIA	These drivers alsosupport DXR in experimental mode.Drivers can be downloaded from  geforce.com

google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	ExoPlayer #	It provides analternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video bothlocally and over the Internet
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	ExoPlayer #	ExoPlayer supports features not currentlysupported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreamingadaptive playbacks
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	ExoPlayer #	Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customizeand extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	Documentation ##	 developer guide :  class reference :  release notes :  developer blog : 
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	Using ExoPlayer ##	ExoPlayer modules can be obtained from JCenter
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	Using ExoPlayer ##	It's also possible to clone therepository and depend on the modules locally.
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	From JCenter ###	The easiest way to get started using ExoPlayer is to add it as a gradledependency
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	From JCenter ###	You need to make sure you have the JCenter and Google repositoriesincluded in the build.gradle file in the root of your project:following will add a dependency to the full library:the library modules that you actually need
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	From JCenter ###	For example the following will adddependencies on the Core, DASH and UI library modules, as might be required foran app that plays DASH content:library is equivalent to adding dependencies on all of the library modulesdepend on external libraries to provide additional functionality
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	From JCenter ###	Someextensions are available from JCenter, whereas others must be built manually.Browse the  extensions directory    and their individual READMEs for details.More information on the library and extension modules that are available fromJCenter can be found on  Bintray   
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	From JCenter ###	extensions directory :  Bintray : 
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	Locally ###	Cloning the repository and depending on the modules locally is required whenusing some ExoPlayer extension modules
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	Locally ###	It's also a suitable approach if youwant to make local changes to ExoPlayer, or if you want to use a developmentFirst, clone the repository into a local directory and checkout the desireddepend on them as you would on any other local module, for example:
google-readmegoogle-ExoPlayer.md	Using Android Studio ####	To develop ExoPlayer using Android Studio, simply open the ExoPlayer project inthe root directory of the repository.
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	While this codebase is relatively self-contained and full-featured, **it is not a "ready-to-ship" fluid simluator**
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	Rather it is a proof of concept and research platform only
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	If you are interested in integrating our network into an existing system feel free to reach out  tompson@google.com  and we will do our best to answer your questions.The entire simulation loop is not optimized; however it is fast enough for real-time applications, where good GPU resources are available  i.e
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	NVidia 1080 or Titan .**BOUNDARY HANDLING**Our example boundary condition code is very rudimentary
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	However, we support the same cell types as Manta  in-flow, empty, occupied, etc , so more complicated boundary conditions can be created
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	One potential limitation is that the setWallBcs codepath assumes zero velocity occupiers  like Manta does 
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	However, it would be an easy extension to allows internal occupied voxels to have non-zero velocity.We do not have a real-time 3D fluid render
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	We use an offline render instead
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	For our 2D "renderer", we simply display the RGB density field to screen and visualize the velocity vectors
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	It is very rudimentary
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	Incorporating an open-source 3D fluid render is future work.The only external forces that are supported are vorticity confinement and buoyancy
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	Viscosity and gravity are not supported  but could be added easily .**UNIT TESTING**We have unit tests  including FD gradient checks  for all custom torch modules
google-readmegoogle-FluidNet.md	Limitations of the current system	The two main test scripts we do have are:
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	GL Shader Validator	! image This is a  Sublime Text 2 / 3  plugin that passes GLSL / ESSL to ANGLE'spreprocessor / compiler for validation.Any errors that ANGLE finds are routed back to Sublime and the tokens inthe shader are highlighted for your convenience and debugging joy.To see the details of the error check the status message in the bottom left of theSublime view.
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Installation	**You can, and probably should, install GL Shader Validator via  Package Control If you would like to install it manually, clone this repo into your packages folder typically ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages .
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Usage	Assuming that you have a  GLSL / ESSL syntax highlighter  installed in Sublime, all you should need to dois install the plugin and your shader code will be validated as expected.It's worth saying that ANGLE expects vertex shaders to have the filesuffix .vert and fragment shaders .frag
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Usage	If you do not name your fileswith that suffix ANGLE  and therefore the plugin  will not be ableto validate your shaders
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Usage	Sadness will ensue.You can set the default specification to use in the settings:This can be overridden in a specific shader by adding comments:
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Permissions	This plugin requires use of a command line utility called essl_to_glsl, which is bundled with the plugin
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Permissions	By default,however, the utility will not have execute permissions
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Permissions	The plugin will attempt to enable those permissions automatically when it loads, butshould that fail you will receive the following error message:> GLShaderValidator: permission denied to use essl_to_glsl commandIn such instances you should enable execute permissions yourself:You can modify the settings file  GLShaderValidator.sublime-settings  insidethe plugin folder
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Permissions	You will find the documentation for the settings inthat file
google-readmegoogle-GL-Shader-Validator.md	Permissions	There aren't many of those right now, but if you want more let usknow via the repo's Issues.
google-readmegoogle-GOS-conventions.md	A convention for Objective-C libraries	The following convention defines a file system structure for a shared Objective-C library.
google-readmegoogle-GOS-conventions.md	Style conventions	GOS libraries use clang-format to automatically clean up stylistic aspects of the source
google-readmegoogle-GOS-conventions.md	Style conventions	Place acopy of  .clang-format  .clang-format  at the root of the library tree.There is a soft  aka: human-enforced  100 character line length limit.
google-readmegoogle-GOS-conventions.md	Jazzy	Your .jazzy.yaml file should contain the following information:
google-readmegoogle-GOS-conventions.md	Travis CI	Your .travis.yml file should contain the following information:for each example app.

google-readmegoogle-GOS-conventions.md	Bootstrap script	This script must beprovided a library name and a path.Example usage:
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	GTMAppAuth for iOS and macOS	GTMAppAuth enables you to use  AppAuth with the Google Toolbox for Mac  Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C For REST libraries by providing an implementation of GTMFetcherAuthorizationProtocolfor authorizing requests with AppAuth.GTMAppAuth is an alternative authorizer to GTMOAuthThe key differentiator isthe use of the user's default browser for the authorization, which is moresecure, more usable  the user's session can be reused  and follows modern OAuth best practices for native apps Compatibility methods for GTMOAuth2 are offered allowing you to migratefrom GTMOAuth2 to GTMAppAuth preserving previously serialized authorizations so users shouldn't need to re-authenticate .
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Setup	If you use  CocoaPods simply add:To your Podfile and run pod install.
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Configuration	To configure GTMAppAuth with the OAuth endpoints for Google, you can use theconvenience method:NSURL *authorizationEndpoint =NSURL *tokenEndpoint =OIDServiceConfiguration *configuration =// perform the auth request...Or through discovery:NSURL *issuer =  NSURL URLWithString:@"" ; OIDAuthorizationService discoverServiceConfigurationForIssuer:issuer  if  !configuration  {  }} ;
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Authorizing	First, you need to have a way for your UIApplicationDelegate to continue theauthorization flow session from the incoming redirect URI
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Authorizing	Typically you couldstore the in-progress OIDAuthorizationFlowSession instance in a property:property to store the authorization state:authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest method, the OAuth tokenexchange will be performed automatically, and everything will be protected withPKCE  if the server supports it .// builds authentication requestOIDAuthorizationRequest *request =// performs authentication requestself.appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow =  if  authState  {  } else {  }} ;
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Handling the Redirect	The authorization response URL is returned to the app via the platform-specificapplication delegate method, so you need to pipe this through to the currentauthorization session  created in the previous session .
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	macOS Custom URI Scheme Redirect Example	  NSAppleEventManager *appleEventManager =   appleEventManager setEventHandler:self  NSString *URLString =   event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject  stringValue ;  NSURL *URL =  NSURL URLWithString:URLString ;   _currentAuthorizationFlow resumeAuthorizationFlowWithURL:URL ;
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	iOS Custom URI Scheme Redirect Example	  // Sends the URL to the current authorization flow  if any  which will  // process it if it relates to an authorization response
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	iOS Custom URI Scheme Redirect Example	 if   _currentAuthorizationFlow resumeAuthorizationFlowWithURL:url   {  }
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Making API Calls	The goal of GTMAppAuth is to enable you to authorize HTTP requests with freshtokens following the Session Fetcher pattern, which you can do like so:// Creates a GTMSessionFetcherService with the authorization.// Normally you would save this service object and re-use it for all REST API calls.GTMSessionFetcherService *fetcherService =   GTMSessionFetcherService alloc  init ;fetcherService.authorizer = self.authorization;// Creates a fetcher for the API call.NSURL *userinfoEndpoint =  NSURL URLWithString:@"" ;GTMSessionFetcher *fetcher =  fetcherService fetcherWithURL:userinfoEndpoint ; fetcher beginFetchWithCompletionHandler:^ NSData *data, NSError *error  {  // Checks for an error
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Making API Calls	 if  error  {  }  NSError *jsonError = nil;  id jsonDictionaryOrArray =  if  jsonError  {  }  NSLog @"Success: %@", jsonDictionaryOrArray ;} ;
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Serialization	The serialization format is different between GTMOAuth2 and GTMAppAuth, thoughwe have methods to help you migrate from one to the other without losing any
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	GTMOAuth2-compatible Serialization	To assist the migration from GTMOAuth2 to GTMAppAuth, GTMOAuth2-compatibleserialization methods are provided in GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility.// Deserialize from KeychainGTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization *auth =// Remove from Keychain GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility removeAuthFromKeychainForName:kKeychainItemName ;You can also serialize to GTMOAuth2 format, though this is discouraged  youshould serialize in GTMAppAuth format as described above .Try out one of the included samples Example-Mac and Example-iOS
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	GTMOAuth2-compatible Serialization	In thefolder run pod install, then open the xcworkspace file.Be sure to follow the instructions in Example-iOS/README.md  Example-iOS/README.md  or Example-macOS/README.md  Example-macOS/README.md  to configure your own OAuthclient ID for use with the example.
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Authorization Method	GTMAppAuth uses the browser to present the authorization request, whileGTMOAuth2 uses an embedded web-view
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Authorization Method	Migrating to GTMAppAuth will require youto change how you authorize the user
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Authorization Method	Follow the instructions above to get theauthorization
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Authorization Method	 You can then create a GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization objectwith the initWithAuthState:authState initializer.Once you have the GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization you can continue to make RESTcalls as before.
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Error Handling	GTMAppAuth's error handling is also different
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Error Handling	There are no notifications,instead you need to inspect NSError in the callback
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Error Handling	If the error domain isOIDOAuthTokenErrorDomain, it indicates an authorization error, you shouldclear your authorization state and consider prompting the user to authorizeagain
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Error Handling	 Other errors are generally considered transient, meaning that you shouldretry the request after a delay.
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	OAuth Client Registration	Typically, GTMOAuth2 clients are registered with Google as type "Other"
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	OAuth Client Registration	This iscorrect for macOS, but on iOS clients should be registered with the type "iOS".If you're migrating an iOS client, in the *same project as your existing client*, register a new iOS client to be used with GTMAppAuth.
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Changing your Authorization Flows	Both GTMOAuth2 and GTMAppAuth support the id authorization
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Changing your Authorization Flows	 This allows you to switchthe authorization implementation under the hood to GTMAppAuth.Then, follow the instructions above to replace authorization request where you ask the user to grant access  with the GTMAppAuth approach
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Changing your Authorization Flows	If youcreated a new OAuth client, use that for these requests.
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Serialization & Migrating Existing Grants	GTMAppAuth has a new data format and APIs for serialization
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Serialization & Migrating Existing Grants	UnlikeGTMOAuth2, GTMAppAuth serializes the configuration and history of theauthorization, including the client id, and a record of the authorizationrequest that resulted in the authorization grant.The client ID used for GTMAppAuth is  different  #oauth-client-registration  tothe one used for GTMOAuthIn order to keep track of the different client idsused for new and old grants, it's recommended to migrate to the newserialization format, which will store that for you
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Serialization & Migrating Existing Grants	 GTMOAuth2-compatible serialization  #gtmoauth2-compatible-serialization  isalso offered, but not fully supported.Change how you serialize your authorization object using the new methodsusing the following example.For deserializing, we can preserve all existing grants  so users who authorizedyour app in GTMOAuth2 don't have to authorize it again 
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Serialization & Migrating Existing Grants	Remember that whendeserializing the *oldthe old client id and client secret  if those changed , and that when serializing to the *newOnce again, pay particular care to use the old details when deserializing theGTMOAuth2 keychain, and the new details for all other GTMAppAuth calls.Keychain migration example:// Attempt to deserialize from Keychain in GTMAppAuth format.id authorization =// If no data found in the new format, try to deserialize data from GTMOAuth2if  !authorization  {  // Tries to load the data serialized by GTMOAuth2 using old keychain name
google-readmegoogle-GTMAppAuth.md	Serialization & Migrating Existing Grants	 // If you created a new client id, be sure to use the *previous  authorization =  if  authorization  {  }
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	What is GTXiLib?	GTXiLib, Google Toolbox for Accessibility for the iOS platform or simply GTX-eyeis a framework for iOS accessibility testing
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	What is GTXiLib?	GTXiLib has XCTest integration andcan be used with any XCTest based frameworks such as EarlGrey  GTXiLib enhances the value ofyour tests by installing "accessibility checks" on them, your existing testcases can double as accessibility tests with no other code change on your part.GTXiLib is able to accomplish this by hooking into the test tear down processand invoking the registered accessibility checks  such as check for presence ofaccessibility label  on all elements on the screen.
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Getting Started	To install GTXiLib on all the tests of a specific test class add the followingsnippet of code to it.// Include the GTXiLib umbrella header.
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	#import 	// Note that that is +setUp not -setUp+  void setUp {   super setUp ;  NSArray *checksToBeInstalled = @    ;   GTXiLib installOnTestSuite: GTXTestSuite suiteWithAllTestsInClass:self Once installed, GTX will run all registered accessibility checks before testcase tearDown and fail the test if any accessibility checks fail
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	#import 	With the abovesnippet of code your tests will now begin to catch issues where you have addedUI elements to your app but forgot to set accessibility labels on them.In the above snippet we have only installed checkForAXLabelPresent, but youcan also install multiple checks from GTXChecksCollection or include your owncustom checks as well:// Inside +setUp ...// Create a new check  for example that ensures that all AX label is not an image name id myNewCheck =  } ;// Create an array of checks to be installed.NSArray *checksToBeInstalled = @  ;// Install GTX on all tests in *this GTXiLib installOnTestSuite: GTXTestSuite suiteWithAllTestsInClass:self Note that GTX is being added to -setUp since GTX must only be installed once  for a given test run .To add GTXiLib to your project use the xcodeproj file in this project or cocoapods 
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Incremental Accessibility	GTXiLib APIs support a practical solution for improving accessibility of largeprojects which may not have included accessibility from the get go accessibility
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Incremental Accessibility	Adding GTXiLib to a project that is already halfway throughdevelopment may leads to several test failures and fixing them at once can betime consuming and tedious
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Incremental Accessibility	To solve this problem incrementally:+ Use above snippet to add GTXiLib to all test cases but fix errors in a small  subset of them
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Incremental Accessibility	 + Blacklist elements that you don't control using GTXiLib's blacklist APIs.+ Then use GTXTestSuite's suiteWithClass:andTests: method to  create a test suite with only the tests cases that have been fixed and add  GTXiLib only to that suite.Once the code is checked into your repo GTXiLib will catch any new failures inthose tests
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Incremental Accessibility	From this point:+ Every new test being added must be added it to the suite.+ Based on team priorities keep moving existing tests into the suite until all  methods are in the suite.If at any point all the tests of a test class are in the suite usesuiteWithAllTestsInClass: method instead of listing all the methods, this alsoensures that new methods added to the class are automatically underaccessibility checking.If GTXiLib is installed on every test in your project, usesuiteWithAllTestsFromAllClassesInheritedFromClass: to automatically addaccessibility checking to any test case added.
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Authoring your own checks	GTXiLib has APIs that allow for creation of your own accessibility checks  in factit does not have to be related to accessibility, for example i18n layout checksor even memory usage checks 
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Authoring your own checks	To create new checks use checkWithName:block: API and provide a unique name and block that evaluatesthe check and returns YES/NO for success/failure
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Authoring your own checks	Add the newly created checkto the array of checks being passed on to GTXiLib via the install API call.
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Dealing with GTXiLib Failures	When GTXiLib fails it has most likely found an accessibility bug and you must fixit
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Dealing with GTXiLib Failures	But due to various team priorities it may not be possible to do so rightaway in which case you have the following options at your disposal:+ Temporarily blacklist the test case by using  suiteWithAllTestsInClass:exceptTests:.+ Temporarily blacklist the offending element using element blacklist APIsBut if you believe GTXiLib has caught a bug that is not an accessibility issueplease let us know by  filing a bug or better  fix it for everyone.
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Integrating GTXiLib into custom test frameworks	If you are test *frameworkaccessibility checking into your test framework
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Integrating GTXiLib into custom test frameworks	GTXiLib's own XCTestintegration is also built using the APIs provided by GTXToolKit
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Integrating GTXiLib into custom test frameworks	UsingGTXToolKit for performing accessibility checks on a given element involves:Creating a GTXToolKit object.Associating a set of checks with it.Use it on the element to be checked.GTXToolKit *toolkit =   GTXToolKit alloc  init ;// Register one or more built in checks: toolkit registerCheck: GTXChecksCollection checkForAXLabelPresent  ; toolkit registerCheck: GTXChecksCollection checkForAXLabelNotPunctuated  ;// and/or add a couple of your own:id fooCustomCheck = } ; toolkit registerCheck:fooCustomCheck ;// Use the toolkit on an element.NSError *error;BOOL success =  toolkit checkElement:someElement error:&error ;if  !success  {  NSLog @"Element FAILED accessibility checks! Error: %@",} else {  NSLog @"Element PASSED accessibility checks!" ;GTXToolKit objects can also be applied on a tree of elements by just providingthe root element.Also, note that checkAllElementsFromRootElements: requires an *arrayelements, not a single element
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Integrating GTXiLib into custom test frameworks	The following snippet shows how to run thechecks on all elements on the screen:
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Analytics	To prioritize and improve GTXiLib, the framework collects usage data and uploadsit to Google Analytics
google-readmegoogle-GTXiLib.md	Analytics	More specifically, the framework collects the MD5 hashof the test app's Bundle ID and pass/fail status of GTXiLib checks

google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	As written, the input stage expects 16-bit, signed integer samples.Any reasonable sample rate may be used, but rates below 16 kHz willintroduce increasingly coarse quantization of the results, and higherrates will incur quadratic increase in computational requirementswithout gaining much in output accuracy.While REAPER is fairly robust to recording quality, it is designed foruse with studio-quality speech signals, such as those recorded forconcatenation text-to-speech systems
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	 Phase distortion, such as thatintroduced by some close-talking microphones or by well-intendedrecording-studio filtering, including rumble removal, should beavoided, for best results
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	 A rumble filter is provided within REAPERas the recommended  default  high-pass pre-filtering option, and isimplemented as a symmetric FIR filter that introduces no phaseThe help text _ -h _ provided by the _reaper_ program describesvarious output options, including debug output of some of the featuresignals
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	 Of special interest is the residual waveform which may beused to check for the expected waveshape
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	  The residual has a_.resid_ filename extension
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	 During non-nasalized, open vocal tractvocalizations  such as /a/ , each period should show a somewhat noisyversion of the derivative of the idealized glottal flow
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Input Signals:	 If the computedresidual deviates radically from this ideal, the Hilbert transformoption _ -t _ might improve matters.
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	The REAPER Algorithm:	The process can be broken down into the following phases:DC bias and low-frequency noise are removed by high-pass filtering,and the signal is converted to floating point
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	The REAPER Algorithm:	 If the input is knownto have phase distortion that is impacting tracker performance, aHilbert transform, optionally done at this point, may improve
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	The following feature signals are derived from the conditioned input:  interpolation of the filter coefficients
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	 It is checked for the  expected polarity  negative impulses , and inverted, if necessary
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	 by the peak energy in the utterance
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	 local RMS
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	 Peaks exceeding a threshold are selected as GCI candidates,  and then graded by a weighted combination of peak amplitude, skewness,  and sharpness
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	Each of the resulting candidates is associated with the  other feature values that occur closest in time to the candidate
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	 signal and its LP residual
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Feature Extraction	 The correlation reference window for  each GCI candidate impulse is centered on the inpulse, and  correlations are computed for all lags in the expected pitch period range.
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Lattice Generation	Each GCI candidate  pulse  is set into a lattice structure that linkspreceeding and following pulses that occur within minimum and maximumpitch period limits that are being considered for the utterance.These links establish all of the period hypotheses that will beconsidered for the pulse
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Lattice Generation	 Each hypothesis is scored on "local"evidence derived from the NCCF and peak quality measures
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Lattice Generation	 Each pulseis also assigned an unvoiced hypothesis, which is also given a scorebased on the available local evidence
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Lattice Generation	 The lattice is checked, andmodified, if necessary to ensure that each pulse has at least onevoiced and one unvoiced hypothesis preceeding and following it, tomaintain continuity for the dynamic programming to follow
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Lattice Generation	Note that the "scores" are used as costs during dynamic programming,so that low scores encourage selection of hypotheses
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Dynamic Programming	Starting at the last peak in the utterance, the lowest cost periodcandidate ending on that peak is found
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Dynamic Programming	 This is the starting pointfor backtracking
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Dynamic Programming	 The backpointers to the best preceeding periodcandidates are then followed backwards through the utterance
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Dynamic Programming	 As each"best candidate" is found, the time location of the terminal peak isrecorded, along with the F0 corresponding to the period, or 0.0 if thecandidate is unvoiced
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Dynamic Programming	 Instead of simply taking the inverse of theperiod between GCI estimates as F0, the system refers back to the NCCFfor that GCI, and takes the location of the NCCF maximum closest tothe GCI-based period as the actual period
google-readmegoogle-REAPER.md	Dynamic Programming	 The output array of F0 andestimated GCI location is then time-reversed for final output.

google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Acai	      Acai makes it easy to write functional tests of your applicationwith JUnit4 and Guice.Acai makes it simple to:example it can help with writing tests which start your backend and frontendserver in a self-contained mode with their dependencies faked out and thenvalidates some key user scenarios with Webdriver to give you confidence yourcomplete system works correctly
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Acai	It can also be useful for tests which validatethe integration of a small set of components
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Acai	Note however that for smallerunit-tests we generally recommend you create the class under test manuallyrather than using Acai.
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Installation	Add a dependency on com.google.acai:acai in your build system to fetch Acaiautomatically from Maven Central
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Installation	For example, with Maven add the following toyour dependencies in pom.xml:|com.google.acai|acai|1.1| for dependency information for other build systems or to simply download the
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Using Acai to inject a test	The simplest test using Acai doesn't register any TestingService bindingsat all, it just uses Acai to inject a test with a module:@RunWith JUnit4.class public class SimpleTest {  @Rule public Acai acai = new Acai MyTestModule.class ;  public void checkSomethingWorks   {  }  }
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Using Acai to start services	The real power of Acai comes when your production server is configuredwith Guice and you create an alternate test module which configures your serverwith heavyweight dependencies like databases replaced with local in-memoryimplementations
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Using Acai to start services	You could then start this server once for all tests in thesuite  to avoid waiting for it to start between each test  and wipe thedatabase between tests  to cheaply isolate test-cases from one-another .The following example shows how this pattern would be used in tests:@RunWith JUnit4.class public class ExampleFunctionalTest {  @Rule public Acai acai = new Acai MyTestModule.class ;  public void checkSomethingWorks   {  }  }  }  }Note that when a module is passed to Acai in a rule any @BeforeSuitemethods are only executed once per suite even if the same module is used inmultiple Acai rules in multiple different test classes within that suite.This allows tests of the server to be structured into test classes according tothe functionality being tested.
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Test scoped bindings	Occasionally you may wish to have one instance of a class per test and injectthis instance in multiple places in the object graph
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Test scoped bindings	In this case Guice'sdefault instance scope will not do
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Test scoped bindings	Fortunately Acai provides a @TestScopedannotation which can be used to achieve exactly this.For example we may define a module for using Webdriver  a popular browserautomation tool  in our tests like so:class WebdriverModule extends AbstractModule {  private static final Duration MAX_WAIT = Duration.standardSeconds 5 ;  protected void configure   {  }  @TestScoped  WebDriver provideWebDriver   {  }  WebDriverWait provideWait WebDriver webDriver  {  }  }One important point to note when using TestingService instances are instantiated once for all tests outside of testscope
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Test scoped bindings	Therefore if you wish to access @TestScoped bindings in a @BeforeTestor @AfterTest method you should inject a Provider and call get on itwithin those methods as shown in the above example.Note that while @TestScoped works well for helpers injected only into tests such as the WebDriver instance in the above example  for fakes and otherobjects which are shared with the system under test it is usually simpler to usea single instance and reset its state with a TestingService
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Test scoped bindings	This techniqueavoids some of the limitations of @TestScoped such as the fact it can only beinjected on the test thread or child threads of the test and makes it possibleto inject the instance into objects whose lifetime is longer than that of anindividual test.
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	Services which depend upon each other	If the services you need to start for tests must be started in a specific orderyou can express this using the @DependsOn annotation.For example:@RunWith JUnit4.class public class ExampleFrontendWebdriverTest {  @Rule public Acai acai = new Acai MyTestModule.class ;  public void checkSomethingWorks   {  }  }  private static class MyFrontendRunner implements TestingService {  }  }In the above example @DependsOn MyBackendRunner.class  which will cause Acai to start thebackend server before starting the frontend.
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	API	As shown in the above examples Acai has a relatively small API surface.Firstly, and most importantly, there is the Acai rule class itselfwhich is used as a JUnit4 @Rule and is passed a module class to be used toconfigure the test.The module class passed to the TestingServiceModule to bind one or more TestingService implementations.The TestingService; Acai will find and run them all when appropriate.For more advanced use-cases where instance scope is not sufficient the@TestScoped annotation can be used to create one instance of a class per testFinally a TestingService implementation can be annotated @DependsOn tosignal its @BeforeSuite and @BeforeTest methods need to be run afterthose of another TestingService
google-readmegoogle-acai.md	API	This provides a simple declarative mechanismto order service startup in tests.Refer to the examples above to see the API in action.

google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	**Description**: A pattern is something that looks like  firstname  lastname 
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	This pattern indicates the API that we want to generate a username with *"the firstname followed by the lastname"*
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	Now, if that username happens to be taken the API will need another pattern
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	Therefore, a list of multiple patterns is recommended
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	For example:*So far so good?*Great
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	Now, say we want to generate a username with *"the nickname followed by the lastname"Well, nickname is a field that should be passed to the  suggest  #suggest-method  method
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	For example:Now say that for someone named *John SmithNow, say we have so many people named "John Smith" in a school district that we ran out of patterns
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	accounts.UsernameGeneration.patterns	We could then define a pattern that adds a number at the end of the username:
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	Adding separators to usernames	A common practice is to separate usernames with a period  
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	Adding separators to usernames	, an underscore  _  or a dash  - 
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	Adding separators to usernames	These separators can be added to patterns
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	Adding separators to usernames	Example:
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	Adding a string to a pattern	Same as the separators, it is possible to add a static string to username suggestions
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	Adding a string to a pattern	For example, the pattern:
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	What if the API runs out of patterns?	The following pattern is used as the last resort: C9_firstname  C9_lastname  #  Generated username | Used patterncarlos.alvarez |  firstname 
google-readmegoogle-account-provisioning-for-google-apps.md	What if the API runs out of patterns?	lastname c.alvarez |  C1_firstname

google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Setup	The dependencies are in  requirements.txt  requirements.txt 
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Setup	 Please make sure these packages areinstalled before running experiments
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Setup	 If GPU capable tensorflow is desired, please followinstructions  here It is highly suggested that you install all dependencies into a separate virtualenv foreasy package management.
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Getting benchmark datasets	By default the datasets are saved to --save_dir flag.Redownloading all the datasets will be very time consuming so please be patient.You can specify a subset of the data to download by passing in a comma separatedstring of datasets via the --datasets flag.
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Running experiments	There are a few key flags for run_experiment.py  run_experiment.py :preprocessing, introducing labeling noise, dataset subsampling, and using adifferent model to select than to score/evaluate.
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Available active learning methods	All named active learning methods are in sampling_methods/constants.py  sampling_methods/constants.py .You can also specify a mixture of active learning methods by following thepattern of mixture_of_samplers-margin-0.33-informative_diverse-0.33-uniform-0.34.Some supported sampling methods include:
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Adding new active learning methods	Implement either a base sampler that inherits from SamplingMethod  sampling_methods/sampling_def.py or a meta-sampler that calls base samplers which inherits from WrapperSamplingMethod  sampling_methods/wrapper_sampler_def.py .The only method that must be implemented by any sampler is select_batch_,which can have arbitrary named arguments
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Adding new active learning methods	The only restriction is that the namefor the same input must be consistent across all the samplers  i.e
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Adding new active learning methods	the indicesfor already selected examples all have the same name across samplers 
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Adding new active learning methods	Adding anew named argument that hasn't been used in other sampling methods will requirefeeding that into the select_batch call in run_experiment.py  run_experiment.py .After implementing your sampler, be sure to add it to constants.py  sampling_methods/constants.py so that it can be called from run_experiment.py  run_experiment.py .
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Available models	All available models are in the get_model method of utils/utils.py  utils/utils.py .Supported methods:
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Adding new models	New models must follow the scikit learn api and implement the following methods small_cnn.py  utils/small_cnn.py for an example.After implementing your new model, be sure to add it to get_model method of utils/utils.py  utils/utils.py .Currently models must be added on a one-off basis and not all scikit-learnclassifiers are supported due to the need for user input on whether and how totune the hyperparameters of the model
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Adding new models	However, it is very easy to add ascikit-learn model with hyperparameter search wrapped around as a supported
google-readmegoogle-active-learning.md	Collecting results and charting	 utils/chart_data.py  utils/chart_data.py script handles processing of data and charting for a specified dataset andsource directory.

google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Alertmanager IRC Relay	Alertmanager IRC Relay is a bot relaying  Prometheus  alerts to IRC.Alerts are received from Prometheus using Webhooks  and are relayed to an IRC channel.
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Configuring and running the bot	To configure and run the bot you need to create a YAML configuration file andpass it to the service
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Configuring and running the bot	Running the service without a configuration will usethe default test values and connect to a default IRC channel, which youprobably do not want to do.Example configuration:
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	this host/port.	http_host: localhosthttp_port: 8000
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Note: SSL is enabled by default, use "irc_use_ssl: no" to disable.	irc_host: irc.example.comirc_port: 7000
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Use this IRC nickname.	irc_nickname: myalertbot
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Password used to identify with NickServ	irc_nickname_password: mynickserv_key
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Use this IRC real name	irc_realname: myrealname
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	Note: By default a notice is sent for each alert in the webhook data.	notice_once_per_alert_group: no
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	The formatting is based on golang's text/template .	notice_template: "Alert {{ .Labels.alertname }} on {{ .Labels.instance }} is {{ .Status }}"
google-readmegoogle-alertmanager-irc-relay.md	"Alert {{ .GroupLabels.alertname }} for {{ .GroupLabels.job }} is {{ .Status }}"	Running the bot  assuming *$GOPATH

google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Google AMP Client ID Library	This Google AMP Client ID library provides a script that you can use to integrate the  Google AMP Client ID API  in your non-AMP pages for custom analytic systems  i.e., for in-house analytics tracking or for analytics vendors that are not  preconfigured for use with the API  The Google AMP Client ID API provides you with the ability to consistently track users across AMP and non-AMP pages.You can learn more about the API and how to customize your analytics systems in the  Google AMP Client ID API documentation 
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Usage	Choose one of the following options to integrate the Google AMP Client ID Library in your non-AMP pages:
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Option 1: Use the compiled binary served on Google CDN  preferred 	 Add the following  tag in your HTML  section: In your JavaScript code, wait for the library load, then call the getScopedCid method:
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Option 2: Copy the code into your own project	The recommended integration of the Google AMP Client ID library is to use binary that is served from CDN  option 1 ,  which saves you from any future version updates
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Option 2: Copy the code into your own project	However, if you prefer not to load the extra binary, you can compile the code into your own project.
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Methods	getScopedCid scope, apiKey, callback : Returns the scoped client ID.The  Google AMP Client ID library uses the AMP_TOKEN cookie to store information
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Methods	This cookie serves two purposes:To persist a security token that is received from the API server, which can be used to exchange CID values next time.To act as a lock so that no concurrent requests are being sent.
google-readmegoogle-amp-client-id-library.md	Testing	To run tests on the Google AMP Client ID library, perform the following:
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	AMP+PWA Demo for Blog and News Sites	A simple, dependency-free blog that uses a Progressive Web App  PWA  to show  Accelerated Mobile Pages   AMP .__This is not an official Google product.__
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Setup	This project requires  Node.js  and  NPM In the root of this repo, run npm install to download all dependencies, andthen npm start to start the server
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Setup	You can visit the site at localhost:8080 Note that this is just a _demo site_
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Setup	Some features  e.g
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Setup	push notifications require a more complex backend that is not implemented here.
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Implementation Details	Our site uses AMP and PWA to create a site that loads as fast as possible, whilestill allowing users to take advantage of some of the most recent web platformfeatures like push notifications and offline browsing.The front end consists of three main components:  AMP version .The first pageview will always be an AMP page
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Implementation Details	If visitors are coming fromGoogle search results, this page will be loaded directly from the  Google AMPcache  In the background,the AMP page will install the service worker, which in turn will cache the appshell page and some other resources.Any further pageview will be intercepted by the service worker
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Implementation Details	It returns theapp shell, rather than the requested page, and the app shell will then load theactual content using AJAX.While the content shown inside the app shell is still valid AMP, we can now usecustom JavaScript to add functionality that is not  yet  supported by AMP
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Implementation Details	Notehowever that this functionality will not be available on the first pageview, orin browsers that don't support service workers
google-readmegoogle-amp-pwa-demo.md	Implementation Details	The App Shell can also interceptlink clicks and use the web history API to create a "single page app".

google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Codiad Managed VMs Docker Image	! Screenshot of Codiad running on MVMs  /codiad-screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot of Codiad running on MVMs" This repo defines a Docker Image that can be used to run Codiad on App Engine Managed VMs.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Codiad	The image is using a heavily customized version of Codiad  whichresides in codiad/third_party/codiad directory.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	IDE Proxy	In order to run the IDE instances for developers in a cloud project, there is an IDE proxy runningon the managed VM which routes the requests to the individual Codiad containers for each developerbased on their email
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	IDE Proxy	The IDE proxy is written in nodejs
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	IDE Proxy	It is responsible for creating a Codiadcontainer for a user as soon as they connect to the IDE
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	IDE Proxy	Thereafter all of the request coming fromthat user will be forwarded to the respective container
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	IDE Proxy	The authentication is done throughappengine
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	IDE Proxy	Proxy code can be found under ide-proxy directory.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Building a dev image to test your changes to IDE	In order to do so, please see the README.md file in codiad directory.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Deploying to a Google Cloud project	Please see the instructions in ide-proxy directory.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	How does it work?	The IDE is deployed as a Managed VM  MVM  module into a cloud project
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	How does it work?	This module is responsiblefor handling requests coming from different users of the IDE and dispatching them to the rightCodiad container
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	How does it work?	The general architecture of the system is as follows:routing requests to them based on user's email address which is registered with the cloud project.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Security	As can be seen in the above diagram, the authentication for each user is done by MVM
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Security	Users areauthenticated with their cloud credential for the cloud project
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Security	The IDE is accessed by all usersusing the same secure URL, e.g
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Security	The Codiad containers are run by project's service account and not by user's credential
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Security	No user'scredential is stored anywhere in the container by the system.Codiad containers for all users are run in the same machine and there is no security boundaryestablished for them
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Security	Hence a user A's container could potentially access user B's container.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Running Codiad Locally	It is possible to run Codiad locally on a machine without using the IDE proxy and MVM hosting
google-readmegoogle-appengine-codiad.md	Running Codiad Locally	Inorder to do so, see the README.md file in codiad directory.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Phabricator-on-App-Engine Docker Image	This repo defines a Docker Image that can be used to run Phabricator on App Engine Managed VMs.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Getting the code	Since Phabricator and its dependencies are fetched as git submodules, you have to include themwhen checking out the code:
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Installing	The source code includes a script named "install.sh", which deploys the image to a Managed VM.Assuming that you have your GCP project's name stored in the environment variable "PROJECT", runthe following:
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Phabricator version	The image is built using a fixed version of the source code for Phabricator and itsdependencies  libphutil and arcanist 
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Phabricator version	These versions are defined by the git submodulesunder the "third_party" directory named "arcanist", "libphutil", and "phabricator".
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Backups	This image automatically backs up the contents of the /var/repo directory to the project's defaultGoogle Cloud Storage bucket
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Backups	Backups are performed every 60 seconds, and on startup the imageautomatically tries to restore from the most recent backup  if one exists .Note that this means you will be billed by GCS for the storage of this backup
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Backups	To help minimizethis, the image automatically deletes the previous backup after generating a new one.
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Git/Phabricator mirror	This image includes a daemon which mirrors code reviews to and from git-notes That allows the Phabricator instance to integrate with the git-appraise command line tool  andmakes the use of the arcanist command line tool optional.Operations performed by the mirror daemon show up as the "git-mirror" bot, which is automatically
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Git authentication	This image includes a git credential helper that automatically authenticates access to Google Cloud Repositories  usingthe service account of the VM  hence the requirement for the projecthosting scope .
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Prerequisites	The built image requires an external MySQL instance, and must be run inside of a GCE VM withthe "" service account scope.There are four environment variables that must be passed to a Docker container running the image: "SQL_HOST": The IPv4 address of the MySQL instance "SQL_PASS": The root password for the MySQL instance "PHABRICATOR_BASE_URI": The URL of the Phabricator instance  for linking back to itself  "ALTERNATE_FILE_DOMAIN": A second URL for the Phabricator instance used for linking to untrusted user content
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Building a dev image to test your changes	The image is built using Make
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Building a dev image to test your changes	The default target builds a new Docker image andtags it with the name "google/phabricator-appengine":You can deploy this locally-built image to a test project using the "deploy" target:
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Building a testing or stable image	*Note that these two rules require permissions that are restricted to the core developer team.*The makefile also defines rules for creating a shared testing image, and uploading it to gcr.io.:..
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Building a testing or stable image	and one for labelling the current "testing" image as "latest"  which denotes our stable image :
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Updating the Phabricator version	This step should be taken with care.The git-phabricator-mirror tool included in this image calls into the conduit APIs provided byPhabricator
google-readmegoogle-appengine-phabricator.md	Updating the Phabricator version	As such, any breaking changes to those APIs need to be preceded by correspondingupdates to the mirror's use of those APIs.This will result in pending changes that have to be committed  and pushed  which update thefixed versions for those submodules.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Apps Script Tools	This is not an official Google product
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Apps Script Tools	It is not supported by the Dart team.This package is still in an experimental state.This package provides tools for using dart2js-compiled programs as Google AppsThe upload program uploads the resulting gs script to Google Drive.The main program makes the development process easier by automaticallyusing those two tools whenever the input JS file is changed.See also  clasp  for a similar tool that isn'tspecialized for Dart, but supports more operations.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Usage	The most common use case is to watch the output file of a dart2jscompilation and upload it as Google Apps script whenever it changes.This is accomplished with the main-script  aka apps_script_watch whenenabled through pub global activate .In its simplest form it just needs two arguments: the input file anda Google Drive destination
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Usage	Every time the input file changes  and alsoinitially at startup  it converts the JS file into a validGoogle Apps script  prefixing it with a necessary preamble  and thenuploads it to Google drive at the given location
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Usage	 This requires anOAuth authentication .Similar to /*Note that Google Apps script must be compiled with the --cps flag of
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Gsify	The gsify executable converts a dart2js-compiled program into a validGoogle Apps script.It prefixes the necessary preamble and optionally add some stub functions,and /The input file must be the output of dart2js with the --cps flag.The following example adds the 
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Upload	upload takes a valid Google Apps script and uploads it to Google Drive.If there exists already a Google Apps script at the provided destinationreplaces the content with the given input script
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Upload	This only works if theexisting Google Apps script only contains one source file.The destination may be prefixed with folders  which must exist .This script uses Google APIs and thus requires an OAuth authenticationwhich is cached for future uses.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Run	run executes the uploaded script
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Run	Scripts must be run in the sameGoogle Cloud project as the Google API that makes the invocation
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Run	Thismeans that the request to run the script must use a clientId/Secret thatis provided by the user.See below  "Remote Script Execution"  for detailed instructions on how toset this up.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Stub Functions	Whenever the Google Apps Script service needs to call into the provided scriptit needs to statically see the target function
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Stub Functions	That is, the providedJavaScript must contain a function with the given name
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Stub Functions	For example,Spreadsheet Addons that want to add a menu entry must have a statically visibleonOpen function
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Stub Functions	The output of dart2js avoids modifying the global environmentand the current JS interop functionality does not give any means to export aDart function
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Stub Functions	To work around this limitation, one can use a stub function thatis then overwritten from within the Dart program.Concretely, running main or gsify with -s onOpen will add the followingJavaScript function to the generated .gs:it is invoked: dart@JS  library main;import 'package:js/js.dart';@JS  external set onOpen value ;void onOpenDart e  {  // Run on-open things like adding a menu.main   {  onOpen = allowInterop onOpenDart ;This  or a similar setup  must be done for any function that the Apps frameworkwants to use as an entry point
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Stub Functions	This includes simple triggers  see the  menu entries,and callbacks from html services
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Using the Script Editor	The easiest way to run a script is to upload it  using one of the providedtools , and then run a function from within the Script Editor.The Script Editor is not connected by default in Google Drive
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Using the Script Editor	If theuploaded script doesn't open on double-click: go to "New" -> "More" -> "Connect more apps" and connect "Google Apps Script".The Editor allows to run  statically visible  functions directly.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Bound Scripts / Addons	Scripts that should be run on an opened document/spreadsheet are called"bound scripts" or "addons".The Script Editor has a convenient 'Test as add-on...' functionality whichopens a file with the script running as add-on.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	Instead of using Script Editor's "Test as add-on...", one can also create abound script directly and then use the uploaded script as a shared library
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	Thisapproach has the advantage that the script will also be loaded when the documentis opened outside the editor
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	It also makes it possible for other users to usethe script without needing to publish it.Create a saved version of the script you want to use as a shared library
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	 File -> Manage versions .Create a bound script: "Tools" -> "Script Editor" from within a openfile  document, spreadsheet, ..
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	.Save the project and give it a name.Link the uploaded script as shared library: Resources -> Libraries -> Add a library
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	 Don't forget to enable the "Development mode"
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	This way uploads to the script are  immediately visible to you  but not other users .Once that's in place, one just needs to forward functions to the shared library.For example, the following bound script forwards the onOpen and hellofunctions from the bound script to the shared library  imported with theidentifier "dart" :possible to create menu entries that call immediately into the sharedlibrary
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	In this case, the function does not even need a stub.For development it's thus convenient to forward the prefix to Dart'sonOpen function:without needing to deal with forwarders or stub functions
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	As a Shared Library	dart@JS  external set onOpen value ;@JS  external set hello value ;void onOpenDart e,  String prefix   {  if  prefix == null  {  } else {  }  SpreadsheetAppvoid helloDart   {  SpreadsheetApp.getUi  .alert "Hello World" ;main   {  onOpen = allowInterop onOpenDart ;  hello = allowInterop helloDart ;
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Using Google APIs	Google Apps script that have been uploaded to Google Drive can be invoked withGoogle API calls
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Using Google APIs	The  Executing Functions using the Apps Script API Guide explains how to remotely execute a specified Apps Script function.Fundamentally, the call needs the following information:However, the scripts.run API has one important restriction: the scriptbeing called and the calling application must share a Cloud PlatformOne can either use the default one created for each script, or move thescript to a different project:The walk-through below details the necessary steps.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Walk-throughs	This section step-by-step instructions on common tasks.For all examples we assume a google-apps and js package:name: exampledescription: Example for Google Apps scripting in Dart.version: 0.0.1
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	#homepage: 	author:   sdk: '>=1.20.1  More -> Connect more appsSearch for Google Apps Script and connect it.In the editor select "create" in the listed functions and press run:! Image of selecting create  pics/select_create.png The first time the script is run it will ask for permissions, and thencreate a new Google Docs document.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Hello World Addon	In this section we create a script that is bound to a document.First create a new spreadsheet
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Hello World Addon	Alternatively you can create a Google Docsdocument, but you would need to change a few lines below.Create the following bin/sheet.dart program: dart@JS  library hello_docs;import 'package:js/js.dart';import 'package:google_apps/spreadsheet.dart';@JS  external set sayHello value ;@JS  external set onOpen value ;void sayHelloDart   {  SpreadsheetApp.getUi  .alert "Hello world" ;void onOpenDart e  {  SpreadsheetAppmain List arguments  {  onOpen = allowInterop onOpenDart ;  sayHello = allowInterop sayHelloDart ;Compile it with dart2js:Upload it to Google Drive:Open the uploaded script in the Apps Script Editor
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Hello World Addon	If a double-clickon the script doesn't work  "No preview available"  see the first example.In the editor run the application by testing it as an addon:! Image of testing as addon  pics/test_as_addon.png Note that the script will add an entry in the Add-ons menu
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Hello World Addon	Ifthe script had been run as a bound script, it would add the menu directlyinto the main menu
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Hello World Addon	We can achieve this effect by using the uploadedcode as a shared library.
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Shared Library	Go back to the script editor from where we launched the add-on test.Save a new version: File -> Manage versionsFind the script-id
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Shared Library	It's available in the URL, or in "File" -> "Project properties".Now go back to the spreadsheet where we want to run this script in.From within the spreadsheet open the Script editor  "Tools" -> "Script Editor" .Copy the following code into the editor  usually "Code.gs" :Go into "Resources" -> "Libraries".Add a new library, using the script-id we retrieved earlier.Use the latest version.Verify that the "Identifier" is correctly set to "hello"
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Shared Library	 You can alsouse a different identifier, but then you need to update "Code.gs" .Enable "Development mode"
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Shared Library	This way a new upload of the apps script isimmediately used
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Shared Library	Note, however, that other users only see the selectedsaved version.Open the spreadsheet again  or reload it 
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Shared Library	It should now add a new menuentry "from dart".
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Remote Script Execution	Start by finishing the "Create Document" tutorial above
google-readmegoogle-apps_script_tools.md	Remote Script Execution	You should nowhave a script "docs_create" in Google Drive.Open it with the Script Editor.First retrieve the project id and the necessary scopes for this project:Publish the script so that the Script's API can find it:"Publish" -> "Deploy as API executable".Now go to "Resources" -> "Cloud Platform project".In the opened window, the editor shows the project the script is currentlyassociated with

google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 In other words, Ashier needs to support dynamicbehavior through custom stateful logic.Ashier solves the first problem with variable markers, which appear on lines2-6 in the ping-output.ahr configuration file  shown below 
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 Each variablemarker line starts with ?, followed by an optional sequence of SPACEcharacters, and then a sequence of 
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	dots
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 The dots on each variable markerline marks the corresponding part of the template as a variable, which tellsAshier to ignore differences there when matching terminal output with thetemplate
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 Each variable marker can also have a name, which appears after theAshier solves the second problem with a controller process
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 When Ashierstarts, it in turn starts another program in the background
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 That runningprogram is the controller process, which implements dynamic behavior forAshier
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 Ashier talks to the controller process by sending messages to itsstandard input
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 In return, the controller process may send data to standardoutput, which Ashier forwards verbatim to the terminal as keystrokes.Here, the last line of ping-output.ahr  above  tells Ashier to send a messageto the controller process  instead of typing into the terminal  when it matchesterminal output to the template
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 The controller program ping-react.py  shownbelow  reads these messages and dynamically generates keystrokes
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 Since Ashierstarts with a new interactive shell, the controller process first enters ashell command to run the ping program
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 Then, it reads 10 Ashier messages each representing a ping response  from standard input and logs each messageto the output file
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 After receiving all 10 messages, it sends the Ctrl-C keycombination to standard output, which terminates ping and drops the terminalback to the interactive shell
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 Finally, it enters the exit command to quitthe interactive shell and stop Ashier.You can now enter the following command to run Ashier, which starts a newinteractive shell
google-readmegoogle-ashier.md	Example: ping	 The -c option points Ashier to its configuration file,and the remaining arguments specify the controller program ping-react.py andits arguments.In the new shell, Ashier automatically runs ping with Ctrl-C and types exit to quit the new interactive shell.

google-readmegoogle-audio-sync-kit.md	Recording hardware	The instructions apply to any ALSA-compatible multi-channel audio recorder.The examples below use the Behringer U-Phono UFO202, a USB device withtwo input ports.The U-Phono is connected to a Linux system from where the recording commandswill be issued.
google-readmegoogle-audio-sync-kit.md	Determining the ALSA device name	The first step is determining the name of the ALSA device corresponding tothe multi-channel recorder
google-readmegoogle-audio-sync-kit.md	Determining the ALSA device name	Many systems have an embedded recording port e.g., the mic in most PCs , so it's important to determine the right device.The most straightforward way to identify the name is by running arecord -L; the additional entries will correspond to the card in question.For the U-Phono, the entries are those with CARD=CODEC,DEV=0:it provides the most direct path to the hardware and reduces the chancesof breaking the simultaneity of the recording.
google-readmegoogle-audio-sync-kit.md	Recording command	Once the proper device name has been identified, the next step is actuallyrecording the audio
google-readmegoogle-audio-sync-kit.md	Recording command	The following command line does it for the U-Phono:Since we're using the direct hardware device, it's mandatory to specifyparameters that are supported natively by the card

google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Overview	This audio editor runs in a web browser and uses the Web Audio API
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Overview	Chimade some efforts to embed it within a web view and make it an Androidapp, but halted after facing memory issues.This project uses Google Closure, which encompasses a javascript compiler,library, Google Stylesheets  GSS  for structuring pieces of HTML 
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Overview	Closure standardizes javascript
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Overview	For instance,it introduces private/protected variables, normal  non-prototypical inheritance like java, and compile-time error checking.This is not an official Google product
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Overview	Chi just thought that the Chrome WebStore needed a nimble audio editing tool, both before and after Android apps canrun on Chromebooks.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Setup	 Install java Give Google Closure build tools relevant execute permissions:The project uses a python script  do.py  for building, which is kind of simple.We're open to using more robust build systems such as bazel or gulp.Some uses:Compile the javascript  including soy templates  and CSS, which is outputted into the build directory:To run the editor, start up a web server in the home repository directory.For example, in the repository directory, runYou can then view the compiled editor at You can view the uncompiled editor at While developing, you don't have to recompile to view changes in the uncompiled version.However, you have to recompile to see changes if you made changes to the dependency graph  altered calls to goog.require ,made any stylesheet changes  changes to GSS files , or altered soy templates  which generate javascript files upon template compilation .
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Coding Guidelines	This project currently uses  Google's javascript style guide To help check for style throughout the project, run python do.py lint in the home audio-cat directory.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Location	Source code is located in the src folder.Soon, each folder will have a README describing its contents
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Location	Each javascript file also contains a block comment describing it.TODO chihuahua : uh..
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Location	do that
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Location	write those readmes.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Organization of JavaScript Classes	In broad strokes, this project's javascript classes fall into 5 categories:
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/state	This folder contains files that maintain the state of individual audio projects.For instance, audioCat.state.Clip encapsulates information about an individual clip within a section.Classes in this folder typically dispatch events when their states change, notifyingother entities such as audio-play-related and UI entities of changes in state.For instance, when a new track is added, the audioCat.state.TrackManager fires an eventnotifying the audio graph to play the track as well as the UI  audioCat.ui.TrackListingManager to visualize the track.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/audio	This folder contains classes related to playing audio and hooking up with theWeb Audio API
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/audio	For instance, audioCat.audio.play.PlayManager maintains thecurrent play status
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/audio	audioCat.audio.AudioGraph maintains the connectionsbetween junctions in the audio graph.Files in this directory heed events dispatched by entities within src/js/original/stateas well as fires its own events for the UI to listen to
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/audio	For instance, whenplaying starts, the UI responds by switching the play icon to a pause icon.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/ui	This folder contains files that updates the UI
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/ui	Classes in this folder typicallyencapsulate state and audio play
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/ui	When the user interacts with the UI, classes inthis folder directly modify the state objects
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/ui	The state then fires events that updatethe UI.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/app	The files in this directory hook up the whole app together
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/app	app.js for instanceis a megamoth file that instantiates the whole app.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/action	This folder contains Action objects that perform a certain action
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/action	Each action object can be retreived from the ActionManager by a specific key
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/action	We can invoke actions based on various interactions.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/utility	This folder is a collection of convenience classes that are used throughout theproject
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/utility	For instance, audioCat.utility.IdGenerator generates IDs uniquethroughout the application used by many types of objects.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/android	This folder contains code that allows the editor to be embedded within an Android web view
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/android	Efforts towards making a mobile app were abandoned after the decision to keep the editor a web app
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	src/js/original/android	This folder is basically a noop.
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Testing	Unit tests currently use Google Closure's junit library
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Testing	To add a unit test,Code up a _test.js and _test.html file
google-readmegoogle-beautiful-audio-editor.md	Testing	See id-generator_test for an example.Run python do.py to aggregate all tests into auto_generated/all_tests.js.Unit tests for certain javascript classes can be run by starting a web serverin the home repository directory, again with sayClick Start to run tests.We currently lack integration tests with say web driver, Selenium, or Google
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	benchmark	   ! Build status     ! slackin  A library to support the benchmarking of functions, similar to unit-tests
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	benchmark	Discussion group IRC channel:  freenode  #googlebenchmark Additional Tooling Documentation  docs/tools.md  Assembly Testing Documentation  docs/AssemblyTests.md 
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Building	The basic steps for configuring and building the library look like this:dependency can be provided two ways:  dependencies.If you do not wish to build and run the tests, add -DBENCHMARK_ENABLE_GTEST_TESTS=OFFto CMAKE_ARGS.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Installation Guide	For Ubuntu and Debian Based SystemFirst make sure you have git and cmake installed  If not please install them The main branch contains the latest stable version of the benchmarking library;the API of which can be considered largely stable, with source breaking changesbeing made only upon the release of a new major version.Newer, experimental, features are implemented and tested on the v2 branch  Users who wishto use, test, and provide feedback on the new features are encouraged to trythis branch
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Installation Guide	However, this branch provides no stability guarantees and reservesthe right to change and break the API at any time.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Further knowledge	It may help to read the  Google Test documentation as some of the structural aspects of the APIs are similar.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Basic usage	Define a function that executes the code to be measured, register it as abenchmark function using the BENCHMARK macro, and ensure an appropriate mainfunction is available:
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	#include 	static void BM_StringCreation benchmark::State& state  {  for  auto _ : state // Register the function as a benchmarkBENCHMARK BM_StringCreation ;// Define another benchmarkstatic void BM_StringCopy benchmark::State& state  {  std::string x = "hello";  for  auto _ : state BENCHMARK BM_StringCopy ;BENCHMARK_MAIN  ;Don't forget to inform your linker to add benchmark library e.g
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	#include 	through -lbenchmark_main to get the same default behavior.The benchmark library will measure and report the timing for code within thefor ..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	#include 	 loop.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Platform-specific libraries	When the library is built using GCC it is necessary to link with the pthreadlibrary due to how GCC implements std::thread
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Platform-specific libraries	Failing to link to pthread willlead to runtime exceptions  unless you're using libc++ , not linker errors
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Platform-specific libraries	See issue #67  for more details
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Platform-specific libraries	Youcan link to pthread by adding -pthread to your linker command
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Platform-specific libraries	Note, you canalso use -lpthread, but there are potential issues with ordering of commandline parameters if you use that.If you're running benchmarks on Windows, the shlwapi library  -lshlwapi  isalso required.If you're running benchmarks on solaris, you'll want the kstat library linked intoo  -lkstat .
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	Sometimes a family of benchmarks can be implemented with just one routine thattakes an extra argument to specify which one of the family of benchmarks torun
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	For example, the following code defines a family of benchmarks formeasuring the speed of memcpy   calls of different lengths:short-hand
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	The following invocation will pick a few appropriate arguments inthe specified range and will generate a benchmark for each such argument.the command above selects   8, 64, 512, 4k, 8k  
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	In the following code therange multiplier is changed to multiples of two.Now arguments generated are   8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2k, 4k, 8k  .You might have a benchmark that depends on two or more inputs
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	For example, thefollowing code defines a family of benchmarks for measuring the speed of setshort-hand
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	The following macro will pick a few appropriate arguments in theproduct of the two specified ranges and will generate a benchmark for each suchprogrammatic specification of an arbitrary set of arguments on which to run thebenchmark
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	The following example enumerates a dense range on one parameter,and a sparse range on the second.Asymptotic complexity might be calculated for a family of benchmarks
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	Thefollowing code will calculate the coefficient for the high-order term in therunning time and the normalized root-mean square error of string comparison.calculated automatically.that might be used to customize high-order term calculation.Templated benchmarks work the same way: This example produces and consumesmessages of size sizeof v  range_x times
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	It also outputs throughput in theabsence of multiprogramming.In C++11 mode, a ranged-based for loop should be used in preference tothe KeepRunning loop for running the benchmarks
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	For example:because KeepRunning requires a memory load and store of the iteration countever iteration, whereas the ranged-for variant is able to keep the iteration countin a register.For example, an empty inner loop of using the ranged-based for method looks like:the benchmark loop should be preferred.In C++11 it is possible to define a benchmark that takes an arbitrary numberof extra arguments
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	The BENCHMARK_CAPTURE func, test_case_name, ...args macro creates a benchmark that invokes func  with the benchmark::State asthe first argument followed by the specified args....The test_case_name is appended to the name of the benchmark andshould describe the values passed.Note that elements of ...args may refer to global variables
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Passing arguments	Users shouldavoid modifying global state inside of a benchmark.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Using RegisterBenchmark name, fn, args... 	The func st, args..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Using RegisterBenchmark name, fn, args... 	 where st is a benchmark::State object.Unlike the BENCHMARK registration macros, which can only be used at the globalscope, the RegisterBenchmark can be called anywhere
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Using RegisterBenchmark name, fn, args... 	This allows forbenchmark tests to be registered programmatically.Additionally RegisterBenchmark allows any callable object to be registeredas a benchmark
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Using RegisterBenchmark name, fn, args... 	Including capturing lambdas and function objects.For Example:auto BM_test =    benchmark::State& st, auto Inputs  { /int main int argc, char*  for  auto& test_input : { /  benchmark::Initialize &argc, argv ;  benchmark::RunSpecifiedBenchmarks  ;
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Multithreaded benchmarks	In a multithreaded test  benchmark invoked by multiple threads simultaneously ,it is guaranteed that none of the threads will start until all have reachedthe start of the benchmark loop, and all will have finished before any threadexits the benchmark loop
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Multithreaded benchmarks	 This behavior is also provided by the KeepRunning  API  As such, any global setup or teardown can be wrapped in a check against the threadsingle-threaded code, you may want to use real-time  "wallclock"  measurementsfor latency comparisons:
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Manual timing	For benchmarking something for which neither CPU time nor real-time arecorrect or accurate enough, completely manual timing is supported usingthe UseManualTime function.When SetIterationTime once per iteration of the benchmark loop toreport the manually measured time.An example use case for this is benchmarking GPU execution  e.g
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Manual timing	OpenCLor CUDA kernels, OpenGL or Vulkan or Direct3D draw calls , which cannotbe accurately measured using CPU time or real-time
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Manual timing	Instead, they can bemeasured accurately using a dedicated API, and these measurement resultscan be reported back with SetIterationTime.static void BM_ManualTiming benchmark::State& state  {  int microseconds = state.range 0 ;  std::chrono::duration sleep_duration {  };  }BENCHMARK BM_ManualTiming ->Range 1, 1UseManualTime  ;
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	To prevent a value or expression from being optimized away by the compilerthe benchmark::DoNotOptimize ..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	 and benchmark::ClobberMemory  functions can be used.memory or a register
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	For GNU based compilers it acts as read/write barrierfor global memory
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	More specifically it forces the compiler to flush pendingwrites to memory and reload any other values as necessary.Note that DoNotOptimize   does not prevent optimizations on in any way
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	 may even be removed entirely when the result is alreadyknown
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	For example:  /  int foo int x  { return x + 42; }  while  ..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	 DoNotOptimize foo 0  ; // Optimized to DoNotOptimize 42 ;  int bar int  __attribute__  const  ;  while  ..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	 DoNotOptimize bar 0  ; // Optimized to:  // int __result__ = bar 0 ;  // while  ..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Preventing optimisation	 DoNotOptimize __result__ ;The second tool for preventing optimizations is ClobberMemory   prevents the call to v.push_back 42  from being optimized
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Set time unit manually	If a benchmark runs a few milliseconds it may be hard to visually compare themeasured times, since the output data is given in nanoseconds per default
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Set time unit manually	Inorder to manually set the time unit, you can specify it manually:By default each benchmark is run once and that single result is reported.However benchmarks are often noisy and a single result may not be representativeof the overall behavior
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Set time unit manually	For this reason it's possible to repeatedly rerun theThe number of runs of each benchmark is specified globally by theRepetitions on the registered benchmark object
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Set time unit manually	When a benchmark is run morethan once the mean, median and standard deviation of the runs will be reported.Additionally the ReportAggregatesOnly bool  function can be used to change how repeated testsare reported
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Set time unit manually	By default the result of each repeated run is reported
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Set time unit manually	When thisoption is true only the mean, median and standard deviation of the runs is reported.Calling ReportAggregatesOnly bool  on a registered benchmark object overridesthe value of the flag for that benchmark.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined statistics for repeated benchmarks	While having mean, median and standard deviation is nice, this may not beenough for everyone
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined statistics for repeated benchmarks	For example you may want to know what is the largestobservation, e.g
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined statistics for repeated benchmarks	because you have some real-time constraints
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined statistics for repeated benchmarks	This is easy.The following code will specify a custom statistic to be calculated, definedby a lambda function.void BM_spin_empty benchmark::State& state  {  for  auto _ : state  {  }BENCHMARK BM_spin_empty   ->ComputeStatistics "max",    const std::vector& v  -> double {  }   ->Arg 512 ;
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Fixtures	Fixture tests are created byfirst defining a type that derives from ::benchmark::Fixture and thencreating/registering the tests using the following macros:class MyFixture : public benchmark::Fixture {};BENCHMARK_F MyFixture, FooTest  benchmark::State& st  {  }BENCHMARK_DEFINE_F MyFixture, BarTest  benchmark::State& st  {  }/BENCHMARK_REGISTER_F MyFixture, BarTest ->Threads 2 ;
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Templated fixtures	Also you can create templated fixture by using the following macros:templateclass MyFixture : public benchmark::Fixture {};BENCHMARK_TEMPLATE_F MyFixture, IntTest, int  benchmark::State& st  {  }BENCHMARK_TEMPLATE_DEFINE_F MyFixture, DoubleTest, double  benchmark::State& st  {  }BENCHMARK_REGISTER_F MyFixture, DoubleTest ->Threads 2 ;
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	You can add your own counters with user-defined names
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	The example belowwill add columns "Foo", "Bar" and "Baz" in its output:and Counter values
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	The latter is a double-like class, via an implicitconversion to double&
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	Thus you can use all of the standard arithmeticassignment operators  =,+=,-=,*=,/=  to change the value of each counter.In multithreaded benchmarks, each counter is set on the calling thread only.When the benchmark finishes, the counters from each thread will be summed;the resulting sum is the value which will be shown for the benchmark.The Counter constructor accepts two parameters: the value as a doubleand a bit flag which allows you to show counters as rates and/or asper-thread averages:  // sets a simple counter  state.counters "Foo"  = numFoos;  // by the duration of the benchmark
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	 state.counters "FooRate"  = Counter numFoos, benchmark::Counter::kIsRate ;  // be presented divided by the number of threads
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	 state.counters "FooAvg"  = Counter numFoos, benchmark::Counter::kAvgThreads ;  state.counters "FooAvgRate"  = Counter numFoos,benchmark::Counter::kAvgThreadsRate ;When you're compiling in C++11 mode or later you can use std::initializer_list:When using the console reporter, by default, user counters are are printed atthe end after the table, the same way as items_processed
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	This is best for cases in which there are few counters,or where there are only a couple of lines per benchmark
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	Here's an example ofthe default output:passing the flag --benchmark_counters_tabular=true is passed:BM_UserCounter to BM_Factorial
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	User-defined counters	This is because BM_Factorial doesnot have the same counter set as BM_UserCounter.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Exiting Benchmarks in Error	When errors caused by external influences, such as file I/O and networkcommunication, occur within a benchmark theKeepRunning   are skipped
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Exiting Benchmarks in Error	For the ranged-for version of the benchmark loopUsers must explicitly exit the loop, otherwise all iterations will be performed.Users may explicitly return to exit the benchmark immediately.The SkipWithError ..
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Exiting Benchmarks in Error	 function may be used at any point within the benchmark,including before and after the benchmark loop.For example:static void BM_test benchmark::State& state  {  auto resource = GetResource  ;  if  !resource.good    {  }  for  state.KeepRunning    {  }static void BM_test_ranged_fo benchmark::State & state  {  state.SkipWithError "test will not be entered" ;  for  auto _ : state  {  }
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Running a subset of the benchmarks	The --benchmark_filter= option can be used to only run the benchmarkswhich match the specified 
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Running a subset of the benchmarks	For example:When the benchmark binary is executed, each benchmark function is run serially.The number of iterations to run is determined dynamically by running thebenchmark a few times and measuring the time taken and ensuring that theultimate result will be statistically stable
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Running a subset of the benchmarks	As such, faster benchmarkfunctions will be run for more iterations than slower benchmark functions, andthe number of iterations is thus reported.In all cases, the number of iterations for which the benchmark is run isgoverned by the amount of time the benchmark takes
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Running a subset of the benchmarks	Concretely, the number ofiterations is at least one, not more than 1e9, until CPU time is greater thanthe minimum time, or the wallclock time is 5x minimum time
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Running a subset of the benchmarks	The minimum time isset per benchmark by calling MinTime on the registered benchmark object.Average timings are then reported over the iterations run
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Running a subset of the benchmarks	If multiplerepetitions are requested using the --benchmark_repetitions command-lineoption, or at registration time, the benchmark function will be run severaltimes and statistical results across these repetitions will also be reported.As well as the per-benchmark entries, a preamble in the report will includeinformation about the machine on which the benchmarks are run.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	The library supports multiple output formats
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	Use the--benchmark_format= flag to set the format type
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	consoleis the default format.The Console format is intended to be a human readable format
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	By defaultthe format generates color output
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	Context is output on stderr and thetabular data on stdout
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	Example tabular output looks like:The JSON format outputs human readable json split into two top level attributes.The The CSV format outputs comma-separated values
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Formats	The 
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Output Files	The library supports writing the output of the benchmark to a file specifiedby --benchmark_out does not suppress the console output.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Result comparison	It is possible to compare the benchmarking results
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Result comparison	See  Additional Tooling Documentation  docs/tools.md 
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Debug vs Release	By default, benchmark builds as a debug library
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Debug vs Release	You will see a warning in theoutput when this is the case
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Debug vs Release	To build it as a release library instead, use:cache variables, if autodetection fails.If you are using clang, you may need to set LLVMNM_EXECUTABLE and LLVMRANLIB_EXECUTABLE cmake cache variables.
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Compiler Support	Google Benchmark uses C++11 when building the library
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Compiler Support	As such we requirea modern C++ toolchain, both compiler and standard library.The following minimum versions are strongly recommended build the library:Note: Using the library and its headers in C++03 is supported
google-readmegoogle-benchmark.md	Compiler Support	C++11 is onlyrequired to build the library.

google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	BinNavi   	Copyright 2011-2016 Google Inc.
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Introduction	BinNavi is a binary analysis IDE navigate, edit, and annotate control-flow-graphs of disassembled code, do thesame for the callgraph of the executable, collect and combine execution traces,and generally keep track of analysis results among a group of analysts.
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Complications from a third-party dependency	BinNavi uses a commercial third-party graph visualisation library  yFiles  fordisplaying and laying out graphs
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Complications from a third-party dependency	This library is immensely powerful, and noteasily replaceable.In order to perform direct development using yFiles, you need a developerlicense for it
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Complications from a third-party dependency	At the same time, we want the community to be able to contribute toBinNavi without needing a commercial yFiles license
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Complications from a third-party dependency	In order to do this andconform to the yFiles license, all interfaces to yFiles need to be properlyIn order to achieve this, we did the following:1  BinNavi and all the libraries have been split into two: The parts of theproject that directly depend on yFiles were split into subpackages calledsubpackages or add code in BinNavi and do not have a yFiles license, you can freely do pretty much  whatever you want in the non-yfileswrap packages put the lib/yfileswrap-obfuscated.jar into your classpath to test and seethe results.If you wish to make changes to the yfileswrap subdirectories, please be awarethat you will need a valid yFiles license to the BinNavi project has to honor their license agreement
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Complications from a third-party dependency	This means thatyou can't simply expose their inner APIs under different names etc.We will enforce this BinNavi with the yFiles dependency, and we will make sure that any code we pullin respects the yFiles license.
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Note for maintainers/yFiles license holders	To rebuild the yFiles wrapper library, first copy third_party/java/yfiles
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Note for maintainers/yFiles license holders	Then rebuild with:
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Building BinNavi from scratch	BinNavi uses Maven for its dependency management, but not for the actual buildyet
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Building BinNavi from scratch	To build from scratch use these commands:
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Running BinNavi for the first time	Please be aware that BinNavi makes use of a central PostgreSQL database forstoring disassemblies/comments/traces running somewhere accessible to you
google-readmegoogle-binnavi.md	Running BinNavi for the first time	You can launch BinNavi as follows:*Note: HiDPI displays may not scale properly with Java Use Java 9 if this is an issue for you.*

google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Bloaty McBloatface: a size profiler for binaries	  Ever wondered what's making your binary big?  BloatyMcBloatface will show you a size profile of the binary soyou can understand what's taking up space inside.Bloaty works on binaries, shared objects, object files, andstatic libraries  .a files 
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Bloaty McBloatface: a size profiler for binaries	 The following file formatsare supported:in adding support for them  I may implement these myself butwould also be happy to get contributions! 
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	Bloaty uses CMake to build
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 All dependencies are included as Git submodules.To build, simply run:Run it directly on a binary target
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 For example, run it on itself.will take when it is loaded into memory
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 The "FILE SIZE"column tells you about how much space the binary is takingon disk
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 These two can be very different from each other:   zero-initialized data .The default breakdown in Bloaty is by sections, but manyother ways of slicing the binary are supported such assymbols and segments
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 If you compiled with debug info, youcan even break down by compile units and inlines!Bloaty McBloatface: a size profiler for binaries.USAGE: bloaty  OPTION ..
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	FILE..
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 -  --tsv  -c FILE  -d SOURCE,SOURCE   Comma-separated list of sources to scan
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 --debug-file=FILE  Use this file for debug symbols and/or symbol table
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Building Bloaty	 -C MODE  --demangle=MODE  --disassemble=FUNCTION  -n NUM  -w  --help  --list-sourcesOptions for debugging Bloaty:  --debug-fileoff=OFF  -v
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Size Diffs	You can use Bloaty to see how the size of a binary changed.On the command-line, pass -- followed by the files youwant to use as the diff base.For example, here is a size diff between a couple different versionsof Bloaty, showing how it grew when I added some features.its previous size
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Size Diffs	 Most sections grew, but one section atthe bottom  .debug_str  shrank
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Size Diffs	 The "TOTAL" line showshow much the size changed overall.
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Hierarchical Profiles	Bloaty supports breaking the binary down in lots ofdifferent ways
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Hierarchical Profiles	 You can combine multiple data sources intoa single hierarchical profile
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Hierarchical Profiles	 For example, we can use thesegments and sections data sources in a single report:values are grouped into an  Other  bin
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Hierarchical Profiles	 Use -n to override this setting
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Hierarchical Profiles	 If you pass -n 0, all datawill be output without collapsing anything into  Other .
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Debugging Stripped Binaries	Bloaty supports reading debuginfo/symbols from separatebinaries
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Debugging Stripped Binaries	 This lets you profile a stripped binary, even fordata sources like "compileunits" or "symbols" that requirethis extra information.Bloaty uses build IDs to verify that the binary and thedebug file match
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Debugging Stripped Binaries	 Otherwise the results would be nonsense this kind of mismatch might sound unlikely but it's a veryeasy mistake to make, and one that I made several times evenas Bloaty's author! .If your binary has a build ID, then using separate debugfiles is as simple as:
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	ELF	For ELF, make sure you are compiling with build IDs enabled.With gcc this happens automatically, but  Clang decided notto make this the default, since it makes the linkslower For Clang add -Wl,--build-id to your link line
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	ELF	  If youwant a slightly faster link and don't care aboutreproducibility, you can use -Wl,--build-id=uuid instead .Bloaty does not currently support the GNU debuglink orlooking up debug files by build ID,  which are the methodsGDB uses to find debugfiles If there are use cases where Bloaty's --debug-file optionwon't work, we can reconsider implementing these.
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Mach-O	Mach-O files always have build IDs  as far as I can tell ,so no special configuration is needed to make sure you getMach-O puts debug information in separate files which youcan create with dsymutil:Any options that you can specify on the command-line, youcan put into a configuration file instead
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Mach-O	 Then use can use-c FILE to load those options from the config file
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Mach-O	 Also,a few features are only available with configuration filesand cannot be specify on the command-line.The configuration file is a in Protocol Buffers text format.The schema is the Options message in src/bloaty.proto  src/bloaty.proto .The two most useful cases for configuration files are:You have too many input files to put on the command-line.For custom data sources, it can be very useful to put
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Data Sources	Bloaty has many data sources built in
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Data Sources	 These all providedifferent ways of looking at the binary
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Data Sources	 You can alsocreate your own data sources by applying regexes to thebuilt-in data sources  see "Custom Data Sources" below .While Bloaty works on binaries, shared objects, objectfiles, and static libraries  .a files , some of the datasources don't work on object files
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Data Sources	 This applies especiallyto data sources that read debug info.
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	Segments are what the run-time loader uses to determine whatparts of the binary need to be loaded/mapped into memory.There are usually just a few segments: one for each set ofmmap   permissions required:Object files and static libraries don't have segments.However we fake it by grouping sections by their flags.This gives us a break-down sort of like real segments.Sections give us a bit more granular look into the binary.If we want to find the symbol table, the unwind information,or the debug information, each kind of information lives inits own section
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 Bloaty's default output is sections.Symbols come from the symbol table, and represent individualfunctions or variables.or --demangle=MODE flag
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 You can also specify thedemangling mode explicitly in the -d switch
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 We havethree different demangling modes:  are omitted
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 For example:  bloaty::dwarf::FormReader<>::GetFunctionForForm<>  
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 This is the default.One very handy thing about -C short  the default  is thatit groups all template instantiations together, regardlessof their parameters
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 You can use this to determine how muchcode size you are paying by doing multiple instantiations oftemplates
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Segments	 Try bloaty -d shortsymbols,fullsymbols.
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Input Files	When you pass multiple files to Bloaty, the inputfilessource will let you break it down by input file:When you are running Bloaty on a .a file, the armemberssource will let you break it down by .o file inside thefiles, but it won't be very useful since it will always justresolve to the input file  the .a file .
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	Using debug information, we can tell what compile unit  andcorresponding source file  each bit of the binary came from.There are a couple different places in DWARF we can look forthis information; currently we mainly use the.debug_aranges section
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 It's not perfect and sometimesyou'll see some of the binary show up as  None  if it'snot mentioned in aranges  improving this is a TODO 
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 But itcan tell us a lot.The DWARF debugging information also contains "line info"information that understands inlining
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 So within afunction, it will know which instructions came from aninlined function from a header file
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 This is theinformation the debugger uses to point at a specific sourceline as you're tracing through a program.Sometimes you want to munge the labels from an existing datasource
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 For example, when we use "compileunits" on Bloatyitself, we see files from all our dependencies mixedfrom, we can write a custom data source
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 It specifies thebase data source and a set of regexes to apply to it
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 Theregexes are tried in order, and the first matching regexwill cause the entire label to be rewritten to thereplacement text
google-readmegoogle-bloaty.md	Compile Units	 Regexes follow  RE2syntax  and thereplacement can refer to capture groups.custom_data_source: {  name: "bloaty_package"  base_data_source: "compileunits"  }  rewrite: {  }Then use the data source like so:bloaty_package source with the original compileunitsHere are some tentative plans for future features.

google-readmegoogle-blue-green-deployment-controller.md	check ReplicaSets, pods, and service created through the custom resource	The controller also creates a service pointing to the active blue RS.
google-readmegoogle-blue-green-deployment-controller.md	Details	The controller runs an infinite loop to check pod spec difference between the active RS and BGD object.If there is a discrepancy, the controller checks whether inactive RS has matching pod spec.If it is a match, the controller changes service to point to the inactive RS and makes the active RS inactive.If it is not a match, the controller deletes the inactive RS, creates a new RS, and waits for all pods of the new RS to become available.After the new RS becomes available, the controller points the service to the new RS and makes the active RS inactive.You can edit the BGD object to roll out new deployment versions:
google-readmegoogle-blue-green-deployment-controller.md	Cleanup	When the controller is terminated, all created resources will stay intact
google-readmegoogle-blue-green-deployment-controller.md	Cleanup	When the controller is rebooted, it will pick up the resources

google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Bochspwn Reloaded	It helped us identify over  70  bugs in the Windows kernel, and more than  10  lesser bugs in Linux in 2017 and early The tool was discussed at the  REcon Montreal   Black Hat USA  and  INFILTRATE  conferences, as well as in the    Detecting Kernel Memory Disclosure with x86 Emulation and Taint Tracking  white paper
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Bochspwn Reloaded	The paper includes a comprehensive description of the general kernel infoleak bug class, as well as an in-depth study of Bochspwn Reloaded and its inner workings
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Bochspwn Reloaded	We highly recommend the read before diving right into the source code, as it may answer many potential questions that may arise while experimenting with the tool
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Bochspwn Reloaded	Specifically, Chapter 3 covers the fundamental ideas behind it and the implementation details of the software.
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Instrumentation types	The repository contains four directories, each comprising a separate Bochs instrumentation module:
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Building	The steps required to cross-compile Bochspwn Reloaded on Linux to run on Windows are enumerated below
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Building	For additional reference, you may find the  Bochspwn documentation  useful.Install the This should result in the creation of a 64-bit PE file named bochs, which can be then copied to a Windows host and run from there:In order to use the newly compiled Bochs emulator on your Windows host, perform the following steps:Download and install Bochs for Windows, which will supply parts of the executive environment such as ROM code not being built into the main executable.Create a bochsrc.txt Bochs configuration file, or modify an existing one.Create a raw disk image with the tested guest operating system, preferably by first installing the OS in a normal virtual machine such as VirtualBox, and then converting a .vdi or other file into the raw format.Extract all kernel drivers from the guest system, and save them on the host machine
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Building	In case of Windows, download the corresponding .pdb files for each of them from the  Microsoft Symbol Server  This is needed to symbolize stack traces in the output log, and to correctly traverse call stacks on 64-bit builds of Windows.Create a Bochspwn configuration INI file, or adjust an existing one to your needs
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn-reloaded.md	Building	For each of the four instrumentation modules, an example configuration file is provided in this repository.If you are testing Windows and intend to attach a kernel debugger to the emulated system, install  WinDbg  on your host, configure the guest to boot in debug mode, and redirect a serial port  COM  to a Windows named pipe in the bochsrc.txt configuration file.Create a Bochs start up batch script  e.g

google-readmegoogle-bochspwn.md	Bochspwn	Bochspwn is a system-wide instrumentation project designed to log memory accesses performed by operating system kernels and examine them in search of patterns indicating the presence of certain bugs, such as "double fetches"
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn.md	Bochspwn	Information about memory references is obtained by running the guest operating systems within the  Bochs IA-32 emulator  with the custom instrumentation component compiled in
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn.md	Bochspwn	It was written in 2013, and was used to discover over 50 race conditions in the Windows kernel, fixed across numerous security bulletins   MS13-016   MS13-017   MS13-031   MS13-036  For further information, see  Read more  #read-more .
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn.md	Support status	The toolset is not actively maintained, and its source code is released "as is", mostly for reference purposes
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn.md	Support status	It was originally released as *kfetch-toolkitInformation about the address space layout of kernel drivers is stored in a separate file  modules.bin by default , and each driver is referenced by its index in the main log file
google-readmegoogle-bochspwn.md	Support status	This was done to save disk space, by preventing the reduntant information  image names and base addresses  from being needlessly saved for every stack trace item in the log.Information about the presence of an active exception handler in each stack frame was added to the access log protocol buffer, allowing us to detect a number of local Windows DoS vulnerabilities  see examples  1   2   3   4 Information about the value of  PreviousMode  at the time of the memory access in Windows was added to the protocol buffer.The "online" double-fetch detection mode was removed from the code, as it was deemed too slow to be practically useful.Some symbolization-related and other minor bugs were fixed in the code.The instrumentation was also ported to Bochs version 2.6.9, the latest one at the time of this writing.

google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	A conversational agent prototyping platform by  Kate Compton 	 This is not an official Google product
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	Bottery is a syntax, editor, and simulator for prototyping **generative contextual conversations*Bottery takes inspiration from the ** Tracery  open-source project for generative text  also by katecompton@ in a non-google capacity  and the  Cheap Bots, Done Quick!  bot-hosting platform, as well as open FSM-based storytelling tools like Twine.The goal of Bottery is to help *everyone*, from designers to writers to coders, be able to write simple and engaging  contextual conversational agents, and to test them out in a realistic interactive simulation, mimicking how they'd work on a "real" platform like DialogFlow.Users in Tracery write **grammars**, JSON objects that recursively define how to generate some text, like  the musings of a lost self-driving car  or  outer-space adventures   Tracery grammars are lists of symbol names  like "animal"  and their expansion rules  like "emu, okapi, pangolin" .In Bottery, users write **maps**
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	Each map is composed of four sub-componentsYou can imagine a Bottery map like a finite state machine or a  boardgame board  there are spaces, and connections between the spaces, and rules for how to move between them
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	 The map itself doesn't change or store information during play
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	 Instead, you have a **pointer*An RPG map might use the blackboard to store the number of hit points for the main character, their current weapon and its stats, their gold, and quest progress
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	 A quiz bot might store all of its categories, questions and answers, the players' current points, and which questions it wants to ask next
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	 You can store strings, booleans, numbers, hierarchical objects, and arrays in the blackboard
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	 Storing and retrieving information is done with a JavaScript-like syntax: foo.bar 5  gets the value at the 5th index of object bar in object foo
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	 foo.baz 10  20  = 10 behaves similarly, though unlike JavaScript, if these parameters don't exist, it will create new objects or arrays and fill them rather than throwing an error
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	What is this?	See parseMapPath in map.js for details.Variables in the blackboard can be accessed from within Tracery with the syntax You have guessed #/guessCount# times.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	States	Each state is a node in the Bottery map
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	States	A state has
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Exits	Exits are described by strings in the format: conditions  ->TARGET_NAME  actions to take when taken Syntax for actions and conditions are described below.If all the conditions are true then the exit becomes active
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Exits	If there are *noThen there is an arrow  ->  and a target
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Exits	 The target is either an **id of a state*The list of actions is in **action syntax*
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	Conditions fall under the following categories:Action syntax is similar to condition syntax:When the pointer enters a state, the following things happen:Any onEnter actions are executed.Any **suggestion chips*All available exits  including the exits specified in the state, as well as global exits  are collected.The pointer then waits for state change
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	At the moment, state change includes user input, and the passage of time
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	If no wait conditions are present, then the bot will wait for user input forever
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	When that state change occurs, the pointer will re-evaluate all the conditions on the currently available exits
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	If all the conditions on an exit evaluate to true, then that exit becomes active.It is often the case that multiple exits are active at the same time
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	For example:If the user types "yes", both exits are active
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	The first exit in in the list of active exits is selected
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Condition	In this case "yes" ->startGame will be chosen.When the pointer uses an exit, the following occurs:The actions associated with the exit are executed.The pointer moves to the state of that exit and the process begins anew.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Interface Overview	! UI overview  doc_images/bottery_ui.png?raw=true 
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Chat	Tab for interacting with the bot
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Chat	Occasionally, the player may be offered suggestion chips  e.g., "heads" and "tails"  that can allow the player to interact without entering text.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Controls	Switches between text and speech, and also commands for working with state.If there are errors in the bot’s underlying script, then they will appear here.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Editor	An inline editor for the underlying bot script
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Editor	A user can edit the script and see changes without having to edit the underlying .js files
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Editor	Changes here will be saved in local storage, so they will only be accessible to the current user.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Blackboard	Displays the current state of the variables known by the bot
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Blackboard	These variables can be used to affect conditional behavior  e.g., the mood of the bot , some tracked information  e.g., the number of correct guesses in a quiz , the name of something  e.g., something the player is allowed to name , and much more.This information is typically invisible to an end user interacting with the bot.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Inspector	Presents a view of the bot’s state machine
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Inspector	This shows all the states that the bot can traverse through, and within them indicates the commands that are executed by the bot, and the ways to traverse to the next state s 
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Inspector	The initial state is always "origin"
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Inspector	This view is not interactive, but is a visual representation of the underlying script.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	State view	This is a representation of the current state of the bot, and the potential next states, as well as the conditions for enabling these particular transitions.
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Viz	Displays the directed connectivity graph of states and exits
google-readmegoogle-bottery.md	Viz	Highlights the current state and any active exit transitions.

google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Budou	 ! PyPI version    English uses spacing and hyphenation as cues to allow for beautiful and legible line breaks.Certain CJK languages have none of these, and are notoriously more difficult.Breaks occur randomly, usually in the middle of a word.This is a long standing issue in typography on web, and results in degradation of readability.Budou automatically translates CJK sentences into organized HTML codewith lexical chunks wrapped in non-breaking markup so as to semantically control line breaks.Budou uses  Google Cloud Natural Language API  NL API  to analyze the input sentence, and it concatenates proper words inorder to produce meaningful chunks utilizing part-of-speech  pos  tagging andsyntactic information.Processed chunks are wrapped with inline-block in CSS.
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Install	Install the library by running pip install budou.Also, a credential json file is needed for authorization to NL API.
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	How to use	Get the parser by completing authentication with a credential file for NL API,which can be downloaded from  Google Cloud Platform by navigating through "API Manager" > "Credentials" > "Create credentials" >"Service account key" > "JSON".import budou
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Login to Cloud Natural Language API with credentials	parser = budou.authenticate '/path/to/credentials.json' result = parser.parse u'今日も元気です', attributes={'class': 'wordwrap'}, language='ja' print result 'html_code'    # => "今日も元気です"print result 'chunks'  0  'word'    # => "今日も"print result 'chunks'  1  'word'    # => "元気です"Semantic units in the output HTML will not be split at the end of line byconditioning each SPAN tag with display: inline-block in CSS.! Nexus Example Image 
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Supported Language	Thai, will be added as Cloud Natural Language API adds support.
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Korean support?	Korean has spaces between chunks, so you can organize line breaking simply byputting word-break: keep-all in your CSS
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Korean support?	No need for Budou : 
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Where to use	Budou is designed to be used mostly in eye-catching sentences such as titles andheadings assuming split chunks would be more stood out negatively in larger typography.
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Caching	Budou supports caching by default in order to save unnecessary requests to NLAPI and make the processing faster
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Caching	If you want to force refresh the cache,put use_cache=False.In a standard environment, Budou will create a cache file with python pickle  format.In  Google App Engine Python Standard Environment Budou will use  memcache to make the cache available across instances.
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Entity mode	Default parser only uses results from Syntactic Analysis for parsing, but youcan also utilize Entity Analysis by specifying use_entity=True.Entity Analysis will improve the accuracy of parsing for some phrases,especially proper nouns, so it is recommended to use if your target sentencesinclude a name of an individual person, place, organization etc.Please note that Entity Analysis will results in additional pricing because itrequires additional requests to NL API
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Entity mode	For more detail about API pricing, pleaserefer to  Pricing | Google Cloud Natural Language API Documentation import budou
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Login to Google Cloud Natural Language API with credentials	parser = budou.authenticate '/path/to/credentials.json' 
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Without Entity mode  default 	result = parser.parse u'六本木ヒルズでご飯を食べます。', use_cache=False, language='ja' print result 'html_code'    # => "六本木ヒルズにいます。"
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	With Entity mode	result = parser.parse u'六本木ヒルズでご飯を食べます。', use_cache=False, language='ja', use_entity=True print result 'html_code'    # => "六本木ヒルズにいます。"
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Maximum chunk length	Some words  マルチスクリーン, インフルエンザ, etc  may stand out in certain formats due to their length
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Maximum chunk length	For example:
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Accessibility	Some screen reader software read wrapped chunks one by one when Budou isapplied, which may degrades user experience for those who need audio support.You can attach any attribute to the output chunks to enhance accessibility.For example, you can make screen readers to read undivided sentences bycombining aria-describedby and aria-label attribute in the output.**Input  your-script.py *input_text = u'やりたいことのそばにいる'element_id = 'description'result = parser.parse input_text, {'aria-describedby': element_id}, language='ja' **Template  your-template.tpl ***HTML Output  your-output.html *  やりたい  ことの  そばに  いる
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	parser.parse   method accepts options below in addition to the input text.| Option | Type | Default | Description || --| attributes | dictionary | {'class': 'ww'} | A key-value mapping for attributes of output SPAN tags
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	|| use_cache | boolean | True | Whether to use caching
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	|| language | str | None | Language of the text
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	If None is provided, NL API tries to detect from the input text
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	|| use_entity | boolean | False | Whether to use Entity mode
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	|| max_length | int | None | Maximum chunk length
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	If a chunk is longer than this it will not be wrapped in a SPAN tag
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Options	|
google-readmegoogle-budou.md	Pricing	Budou is backed up by Google Natural Language API, so cost may be incurred whenusing that API.In other languages including Japanese, the default parser uses *Syntax AnalysisIf you enable Entity mode by specifying use_entity=True, the parser uses bothof *Syntax Analysiswhich will incur additional cost.Google Cloud Natural Language API has free quota to start testing the feature atfree of cost, but please refer to  Google Cloud Natural Language API Pricing Guide for more detailed pricing information.

google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections for Dart	  
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Introduction	Built Collections are immutable collections using the builder pattern Each of the core SDK collections is split in two: a mutable builder classand an immutable "built" class
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Introduction	Builders are for computation,"built" classes are for safely sharing with no need to copy defensively.Immutable collections work particularly well with immutable values
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Introduction	See built_value You can read more about built_collection on medium 
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Design	Built Collections:
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	A note about strong mode	Please note that from version 1.1.0 built_collection must be used inconjunction with strong mode to get all the type guarantees
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	A note about strong mode	That is, your project must have no warnings orerrors when analyzed with the strong mode analyzer
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	A note about strong mode	This allows some runtimechecks to be skipped because the equivalent check can be done statically.
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Recommended Style	A project can benefit greatly from using Built Collections throughout.Methods that will not mutate a collection can accept the "built" version,making it clear that no mutation will happen and completely avoidingthe need for defensive copying.For code that is public to other projects or teams not usingBuilt Collections, prefer to accept Iterable where possible
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Recommended Style	That wayyour code is compatible with SDK collections, Built Collections and anyother collection implementation that builds on Iterable.It's okay to accept BuiltMap.toMap and BuiltSetMultimap.toMap.
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Immutable	Built Collections do not offer any methods that modify the collection
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Immutable	Inorder to make changes, first call toBuilder to get a mutable builder.In particular, Built Collections do not implement or extend their mutablecounterparts
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Immutable	BuiltSetMultimap share no interface with the SDK collections.Built Collections can contain mutable elements
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Immutable	However, this use is notrecommended, as mutations to the elements will break comparison and
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Comparable	Core SDK collections do not offer equality checks by default.Built Collections do a deep comparison against other Built Collectionsof the same type, only
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Comparable	Hashing is used to make repeated comparisons fast.
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Hashable	Core SDK collections do not compute a deep hashCode.Built Collections do compute, and cache, a deep hashCode
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Hashable	That means theycan be stored inside collections that need hashing, such as hash sets andhash maps
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections are Hashable	They also use the cached hash code to speed up repeated
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Reject Nulls	A null in a collection is usually a bug, so Built Collections and theirbuilders throw if given a null element, key or value.
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Require Generic Type Parameters	A List is error-prone because it can be assigned to a List ofany type without warning
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Require Generic Type Parameters	So, all Built Collections must be created withexplicit element, key or value types.
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Reject Wrong-type Elements, Keys and Values	Collections that happen to contain elements, keys or values that are not ofthe right type can lead to difficult-to-find bugs
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Reject Wrong-type Elements, Keys and Values	So, all BuiltCollections and their builders are aggressive about validating types, evenwith checked mode disabled.
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Avoid Copying Unnecessarily	Built Collections and their builder and helper types collaborate to avoidcopying unless it's necessary.In particular, BuiltSet.toSet, BuiltMap.toMap and BuiltSetMultimap.toMap do not makea copy, but return a copy-on-write wrapper
google-readmegoogle-built_collection.dart.md	Built Collections Avoid Copying Unnecessarily	So, Built Collections can beefficiently and easily used with code that needs core SDK collections butdoes not mutate them.When you want to provide a collection that explicitly _throws_ when amutation is attempted, use BuiltListMultimap.asMap, BuiltSet.asSet, BuiltSetMultimap.asMapand BuiltMap.asMap.

google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Articles	Note that you need adev dependency on built_value_generator and build_runner
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Articles	See the example pubspec.yaml If using Flutter, the equivalent command is flutter packages pub run build_runner build.Alternatively, put your built_value classes in a separate Dart package with no dependencyon Flutter
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Articles	You can then use built_value as normal.If using a version before v5.2.0, codegen is triggered via either a build.dart to do a one-off build or a watch.dart to continuously watch your source and update generated output.
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	Value types are, for our purposes, classes that are consideredinterchangeable if their fields have the same values.Common examples include Date, Money and Url
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	Most code introducesits own value types
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	For example, every web app probably has someversion of Account and User.Value types are very commonly sent by RPC and/or stored for laterThe problems that led to the creation of the Built Value library have discussed at great length in the context of AutoValue for Java.In short: creating and maintaining value types by hand requires a lot ofboilerplate
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	It's boring to write, and if you make a mistake, you verylikely create a bug that's hard to track down.Any solution for value types needs to allow them to participate in objectoriented design
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	Date, for example, is the right place for code thatdoes simple date manipulation
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	AutoValue solves the problem for Java with code generation, and Built Values doesthe same for Dart
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Value Types	The boilerplate is generated for you, leaving you tospecify which fields you need and to add code for the behaviour of the
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Generating boilerplate for Value Types	Value types require a bit of boilerplate in order to connect it to generatedcode
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Generating boilerplate for Value Types	Luckily, even this bit of boilerplate can be got automated using codesnippets support in your favourite text editor
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Generating boilerplate for Value Types	For example, in IntelliJ youcan use following live template:class name which is something that can't be automated.
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Enum Classes provide classes with enum features.Enums are very helpful in modelling the real world: whenever there are asmall fixed set of options, an enum is a natural choice
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	For an objectoriented design, though, enums need to be classes
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Dart falls short here,so Enum Classes provide what's missing!Built Values comes with JSON serialization support which allows you toserialize a complete data model of Built Values, Enum Classes andBuilt Collections
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	The chat example  shows how easy this makes building a full application with Dart on the server andHere are the major features of the serialization support:It _fully supports object oriented design_: any object model that you can design can be serialized, including full use of generics and interfaces.Some other libraries require concrete types or do not fully support generics.It _allows different object oriented models over the same data_
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Forexample, in a client server application, it's likely that the client and serverwant different functionality from their data model
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	So, they are allowed to havedifferent classes that map to the same data
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Most other libraries enforce a 1:1mapping between classes and types on the wire.It _requires well behaved types_
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	They must be immutable, can useinterface but not concrete inheritance, must have predictable nullability,hashCode, equals and toString
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	In fact, they must be Enum Classes, BuiltCollections or Built Values
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Some other libraries allow badly behaved types tobe serialized.It _supports changes to the data model_
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Optional fields can be added orremoved, and fields can be switched from optional to required, allowing yourdata model to evolve without breaking compatbility
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Some other libraries breakcompatability on any change to any serializable class.It's _modular_
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Each endpoint can choose which classes to know about;for example, you can have multiple clients that each know about only a subset ofthe classes the server knows
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Most other libraries are monolithic, requiring allendpoints to know all types.It's _multi language_
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Support will be come first for Dart, Java andJava/GWT
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Many other libraries support a single language only.It _has first class support for validation_ via Built Values
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	An important part of a powerful data model is ensuring it's valid, so classes can makeguarantees about what they can do
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Other libraries also support validationbut usually in a less prominent way.It's _pluggable_
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	You can add serializers for your own types, and you can add plugins which run before and after all serializers
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	This could be used tointeroperate with other tools or to add hand coded high performance serializersfor specific classes
google-readmegoogle-built_value.dart.md	Enum Class	Some other libraries are not so extensible.

google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Introduction	Butteraugli not only gives a scalar score, but alsocomputes a spatial map of the level of differences.One of the main motivations for this project is the statistical differences inlocation and density of different color receptors, particularly the low densityof blue cones in the fovea
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Introduction	Another motivation comes from more accurate modelingof ganglion cells, particularly the frequency space inhibition.
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Use	Butteraugli can work as a quality metric for lossy image and video compression.On our small test corpus butteraugli performs better than our implementations ofthe reference methods, psnrhsv-m, ssim, and our yuv-color-space variant of ssim.One possible use is to define the quality level setting used in a jpegcompressor, or to compare two or more compression methods at the same level ofpsychovisual differences.Butteraugli is intended to be a research tool more than a practical tool forchoosing compression formats
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Use	We don't know how well butteraugli performs withmajor deformations -roughly corresponding to jpeg qualities 90 to 
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Interface	Only a C++ interface is provided
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Interface	The interface takes two images and outputs amap together with a scalar value defining the difference
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Interface	The scalar value canbe compared to two reference values that divide the value space into threeexperience classes: 'great', 'acceptable' and 'not acceptable'.
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Build instructions	Install  Bazel  by following the instructions  Run bazel build -c opt//:butteraugli in the directory that contains this README file to build the command-line utility  #cmdline-tool 
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Build instructions	If you want to use Butteraugli as alibrary, depend on the //:butteraugli_lib target.Alternatively, you can use the Makefile provided in the butteraugli directory,after ensuring that  libpng  and libjpeg  are installed
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Build instructions	On some systems you might need to alsoinstall corresponding -dev packages.The code is portable and also compiles on Windows after defining_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS in the project settings.
google-readmegoogle-butteraugli.md	Command-line utility {#cmdline-tool}	Butteraugli, apart from the library, comes bundled with a comparison tool

google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Serialization	The first core feature for an RPC framework is some kind of serializationmechanism &ndash; a way to convert different kinds of data structures to and fromsequences of bytes, ready for transmission between processes.A serialization mechanism typically includes a number of base types &ndash;integers, characters, booleans, floating point values, strings &ndash; that maponto the base types of the programming language.On top of the base types, various compound types are normally available:The serialization mechanism for an RPC framework may or may not require the useof an explicit **schema**, which describes the valid data structures for aparticular RPC interface
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Serialization	 For example, to transmit the data for a 3-dimensionalFrameworks with schemas are more complex and require more set-up  to specifythe schema , but are more robust &ndash; messages that don't match the expectedschema can be automatically detected and rejected.
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Transport	Once a collection of information has been serialized, it needs to betransmittted to the other process involved in the RPC exchange
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Transport	 This requires atransport mechanism, but the RPC framework may or may not consider this part oftheir remit:
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	RPC Invocation	To be convenient, invoking functionality in a different process needs to be morethan just sending and receiving messages
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	RPC Invocation	 Ideally, it should take a similarform to invoking functionality in the same process, via a function call
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	RPC Invocation	 To dothis, the RPC mechanism needs to bundle up all of the input parameters for aremote function into a **request*from the function invocation
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	RPC Invocation	  As the two processes do not normally share anaddress space, this approach works best with data that is passed by value .
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Event Model and Threading	Sending and receiving messages between processes requires some sort of eventprocessing system that handles receipt notifications and  possibly  inter-threadscheduling
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Event Model and Threading	 An RPC framework may include an event processing model, or mayrequire the application to integrate RPC processing into its own existing eventmodel in some way
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Event Model and Threading	 An RPC framework may also require the use of multiplethreads, or may be written assuming use in a single-threaded manner  and thusneed external synchronization for use in a multi-threaded application .The event model also affects whether it is possible for invocation of remotefunctionality to look identical to invocation of local functionality i.e
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Event Model and Threading	apparently synchronous .
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	File Descriptor Transfer	For sandboxing mechanisms that restrict access to the local environment e.g
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	File Descriptor Transfer	Capsicum , it is important to know whether the RPC framework allows thetransfer of file descriptors between processes on the same machine; thisallows a remote process to operate on a kernel resource owned by the invoker,even though the remote process cannot open that resource on its own.Any such mechanism relies on the SCM_RIGHTS feature of an underlying UNIXdomain socket transport.
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Language Support	Some RPC frameworks include support for applications written in differentlanguages, which in turn would allow for different components of a privilegeseparated application to be written in different languages.Note that C and C++ are a special case here; a C-based framework can alwaysbe used by C++ code, and it's often possible to write a C wrapper layer thatallows a C++-based framework to be used
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Language Support	 However, this does normally stillinvolve a run-time dependency on the libstdc++ C++ standard library.
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Dependencies	Simpler RPC frameworks are self-contained, and have no additionaldependencies; others impose a requirement that dependent libraries  e.g
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Dependencies	thelibstdc++ for a C++ framework  are available on the system
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Dependencies	 The set ofdependencies needed for an application written in C is of particular interest.RPC Framework CandidatesThis section gives an overview of possible candidate RPC frameworks
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Dependencies	 It doesnot include technologies that are purely serialization mechanisms  e.g
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Dependencies	ASN.1  withoutany RPC aspects.
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Hand-Rolled Code	The least common denominator for performing RPC is not to use any framework, butto individually code the mechanisms required.FreeBSD 11.x includes the libnv library created by Pawel Jakub Dawidek, which deals with building andtransferring lists of name-value pairs.D-Bus is a message bus system intended for use in UNIX desktop systems
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Hand-Rolled Code	 Bydefault, it assumes that applications will communicate via either asystem-wide or session-wide daemon; however, it is possible to set up aprivate point-to-point connection between two processes
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Hand-Rolled Code	gRPC  was released in 2015 by Google, as a general RPCframework
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Hand-Rolled Code	 gRPC uses an updated  v3  version of protocol buffers for itsserialization mechanism, but also includes communication libraries for RPCclient and server applications.Note that although gRPC claims to support C  and its core internals are writtenin C , there is no C API for serialization or RPC invocation
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Hand-Rolled Code	Cap'n Proto  was created for the Sandstorm  project by Kenton Varda  who was one of thecreators of V2 of Google's protocol buffers 
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Hand-Rolled Code	bzip2  is the example target used to explore thedifferences between different RPC frameworks; this target is chosen because Ben Laurie  has previously manually converted  it to be privilegedseparated in order to apply the Capsicum security framework It is also of a manageable size, without being too trivial.To make bzip2 more suitable for having a remote implementation, we first makea couple of modifications to the library.
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: FILE	The bzlib API includes a number of entrypoints that take a FILE* argument;however, this is not a good type to be used on an inter-process boundary,because the C library adds buffering and other metadata that cannot be easilymirrored between processes.To cope with this, we add ...OpenFd   entrypoints that are analogous to theexisting ...Open   entrypoints, but which take a file descriptor argumentinstead of a FILE* argument.
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: Streaming API Entrypoints	As it stands, the bzip2 codebase includes a BZ2_bz..
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: Streaming API Entrypoints	  functions in libbz2  and a main command-line utility bzip2that uses that API to do compression and decompression
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: Streaming API Entrypoints	 However, the API isquite low-level, involving reading and writing chunks of data from thecompressed file; it does not include any entrypoints that process an entirefile at once.The compressStream and decompressStream, which loop around using the bzlibentrypoints; these are the entrypoints that are remoted in the manualremoting example for Capsicum mentioned above.Therefore, in order to compare like with like, we add an additional wrapperlayer to the bzlib API, with the following entrypoints:
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: Annotate API	The process of generating serialization and deserialization code that mapsbetween function parameters and message fields is tedious and time-consumingto do manually
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: Annotate API	 To allow for the future possibility of a tool to automatethis process, we extend the bzlib.h header file with extra annotations.These annotations give a richer semantics than the base C language allows cf
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	Modification: Annotate API	Microsoft's Security Annotation Language for example:IDL_GENERATE is defined, so a normal build of the library is unaffected.API Remoting StructureAll of the API remoting examples in this repository share a similar baseThis sequence diagram assumes that the second process is already available;that can be accomplished on first use of the API by forking a sub-process thatin turn invokes a new program containing the API driver program:! RPC Process Setup  rpc-setup.png 
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	File Descriptor Inheritance	Not all of the RPC frameworks used support the passing of file descriptorsover their transports
google-readmegoogle-bzip2-rpc.md	File Descriptor Inheritance	 For those that do not  gRPC and Cap'n Proto , wecurrently use a UNIX socket that runs in parallel to the main RPC socket.To send a file descriptor: Note that this mechanism is currently implemented in a naive fashion,with no integration of the parallel socket into the program's event loop

google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Installation	To add a dependency using Maven:            To add a dependency using Gradle:  dependencies {  }    dependencies {  }  
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API docs	To use push messaging services to send messages to connected devices, developers must send themthrough a third party messaging service, such as Firebase Cloud Messaging   FCM .It’s simple to encrypt message contents between the developer and the messaging service using https.Major messaging services, including  FCM  alsoencrypt messages between their servers and client devices.However, messages between the developer server and the user devices are not encryptedend-to-end  E2E :! no e2ee  img/no_e2ee.png E2E encryption can be achieved by generating an asymmetric encryption key pair on the client,registering the public key with the developer messaging service, encrypting outgoing messages withthe public key, and decrypting messages on the client using the private key:! with capillary  img/with_capillary.png Capillary handles these operations for push messaging services used by Android apps
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API docs	It includes: KitKat   API level 19 .As a bonus, it also allows developers to require that devices are unlocked before selected messagescan be decrypted
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API docs	This includes messages on devices using File-Based Encryption   FBE :encrypted messages are cached in Device Encrypted  DE  storage and message decryption keys arestored in Android keystore  requiring user authentication This allows developers to specify messages with sensitive content to remain encrypted in cached formuntil the user has unlocked and decrypted their device.

google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Web Push vs RSA-ECDSA	 Web Push protocol is based on the Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman  ECDH  key exchange algorithm,  which is highly efficient for performance-constrained devices
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Web Push vs RSA-ECDSA	Note that apps  as opposed to  browsers  cannot receive raw Web Push messages through FCM, but Web Push messages can easily be  wrapped in the appropriate FCM JSON by a proxy implementation, allowing you to use the same  infrastructure with minor modifications

google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Web Push vs RSA-ECDSA	RSA crypto  operations  encrypt, decrypt  are supported by Android Keystore from SDK versions 18  Jelly Bean   and above, meaning key material is not available outside of the trusted execution environment
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Web Push vs RSA-ECDSA	 This means even a sophisticated attacker with access to the device memory cannot access private  key material  for example, to decrypt future messages arriving in Direct Boot mode .
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Auth vs NoAuth	Auth bound keys ensures that messages cannot be read by users when their device is locked, meaningsensitive content will not be readable by shoulder-surfers or if the device is lost or stolen.
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API Overview	Capillary provides the core crypto functionality required to send  from an application server  andreceive encrypted push messages in Android apps
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API Overview	This covers:Because server-side architectures and push messaging use-cases are many and varied, it is notpractical to provide a server-side API to handle all possible push message implementations.Therefore, we have decoupled the crypto functionality above from message transmission andserver-side key storage/retrieval functions
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API Overview	We have, however, provided a full-stack implementationthat uses Capillary to send E2E-encrypted push messages from a Java-based server to Android clientsin the  demo application  demo 
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API Overview	In summary, you will need to implement the following aspects of thesolution yourself  using the  demo application  demo  and instructions below for guidance whererequired :  the screen .
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	API Integration	Please follow the following steps to integrate with the Capillary library.
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Prerequisites	Before the Capillary library can be used, it must be initialized at runtime as follows:import com.google.capillary.Config;Config.initialize  ;If you are using RSA-ECDSA algorithm, you need to generate an ECDSA public/private key pair and makethe public key available to your Android app  e.g., as a raw resource and private key available to your application server
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Prerequisites	Use the  utility program  tools  that we haveprovided to generate such ECDSA key pairs:
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Capillary Handler Implementation	The Capillary library uses methods of the  CapillaryHandler  lib-android/src/main/java/com/google/capillary/android/CapillaryHandler.java interface to provide responses, such as public keys, decrypted plaintexts, etc., back to the Androidapp
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Capillary Handler Implementation	Therefore, the first step in integrating an Android app with the Capillary library is toimplement the CapillaryHandler  lib-android/src/main/java/com/google/capillary/android/CapillaryHandler.java interface with your app-specific logic to handle the responses mentioned above
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Capillary Handler Implementation	You can see howthe Capillary library's  demo Android app  demo/android  implements the CapillaryHandler  lib-android/src/main/java/com/google/capillary/android/CapillaryHandler.java  interfacein  DemoCapillaryHandler  demo/android/src/main/java/com/google/capillary/demo/android/DemoCapillaryHandler.java  class.
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Key Generation	Each Capillary key pair is identified by a key pair ID  aka keychain ID , which is an arbitrarystring that is up to you to decide
google-readmegoogle-capillary.md	Key Generation	To generate a key pair:import android.content.Context;import com.google.capillary.android.RsaEcdsaKeyManager;import com.google.capillary.android.WebPushKeyManager;import java.io.InputStream;Context context = ..

google-readmegoogle-capsicum-test.md	Capsicum User Space Tests	This directory holds unit tests for  Capsicum object-capabilities
google-readmegoogle-capsicum-test.md	Capsicum User Space Tests	The tests exercise the syscall interface to a Capsicum-enabled operating system,currently either  FreeBSD >=10.x  or a modified Linux kernel  the capsicum-linux  project .The tests are written in C++98, and use the  Google Test framework, with some additions to fork off particular tests  because a process that enters capabilitymode cannot leave it again .
google-readmegoogle-capsicum-test.md	Provenance	The original basis for these tests was:comparative testing across multiple OSes, and then substantially extended.
google-readmegoogle-capsicum-test.md	Linux	The following additional development packages are needed to build the full test suite on Linux.The Capsicum userspace library is held in the libcaprights/ subdirectory
google-readmegoogle-capsicum-test.md	Linux	 Ideally, thislibrary should be built  with ./configure; make or dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us  andinstalled  with make install or dpkg -i libcaprights*.deb  so that the tests willuse behave like a normal Capsicum-aware application.However, if no installed copy of the library is found, the GNUmakefile will attemptto use the local libcaprights/*.c source; this requires ./configure to have beenperformed in the libcaprights subdirectory

google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	 Capture Thread Library  google/capture-thread 	Framework for loggers, tracers, and mockers in multithreaded C++ programs.* This is not an official Google product
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	 Capture Thread Library  google/capture-thread 	*
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Motivation	When developing C++ projects,  instrumentation  instrumentation  is frequentlyused to collect information from the system, inject information into the system,or both
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Motivation	The role of this information within the system rarely lines up with theactual structure of the project.For example:This library is designed to handle all of these situations with minimalintrusion into your project, and without leaking details in your API.
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Summary	The **Capture Thread Library*thread-locality, which allows the sharing of static variables *only within thecurrent thread*
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Summary	Canonical static variables, on the other hand, are problematicdue to ownership and thread-safety issues.This library establishes the following idiom * using logging as an example *: The instrumentation is 100% passive unless it is explicitly enabled
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Summary	* For Instrumentation is enabled in the current thread by *instantiating While enabled, the instrumentation transparently alters the behavior of Instrumentation can be shared across threads in *explicitly-specified
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Key Design Points	The **Capture Thread Library*and reliable:
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Caveats	In some cases, it might not be appropriate  or possible  to use the **CaptureThread Library**:
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Quick Start	Instrumenting a project has four steps
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Quick Start	These assume that your project isalready functional, and is just lacking instrumentation
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Quick Start	Create an instrumentation class to contain the state to be shared
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Quick Start	Instrument your project with logging points, tracing points, or mocking Where control is passed between threads, e.g., creating a thread or passing As needed, instantiate the instrumentation class es  to enable theComplexity estimates below are estimates of how much additional work will benecessary as your project grows.
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 1: Instrumentation Class  O 1  	The instrumentation class es  will generally be written once and then leftalone
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 1: Instrumentation Class  O 1  	They might also be general enough for use in multiple projects.
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	// This class provides the instrumentation logic, both at the point the// instrumentation is used  e.g., logging points  and where it is enabled  e.g.,// log-capture points
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	 Note that instances of ThreadCapture cannot be moved,// copied, or dynamically allocated.class Logger : public capture_thread::ThreadCapture { public:  Logger   : cross_and_capture_to_ this  {}  // no-op if no instrumentation is in scope
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	 static void Log const std::string& line  {  }  // to access its contents
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	This is only necessary when the instrumentation is  // gathering information, as opposed to propagating information
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	 std::list GetLines   {  } private:  // The private implementation applies to the instrumentation only when it's in  // scope
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	This does not need to exactly mirror the static API, and in fact  // only needs to differentiate between default and override behaviors
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	 void LogLine const std::string& line  {  }  std::list lines_;  // Add an AutoThreadCrosser to ensure that scoping is handled correctly
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	If  // you absolutely don't want the instrumentation crossing threads, use  // ScopedCapture instead
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-capture.h"	Always initialize with 
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 2: Instrument the Code  O n  	Instrumenting the code with your new instrumentation class will generallyconsist of one-line additions throughout the code
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 2: Instrument the Code  O n  	There will often be a largenumber of instrumentation points in the code.// #include the header for your instrumentation class.// This function already exists in your code, and performs some sort of work for// which you want to use the instrumentation.void MyExistingFunction   {  // Add calls to the static API where you need access to the instrumentation
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 2: Instrument the Code  O n  	 Logger::Log "MyExistingFunction called" ;
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 3: Cross Threads  O log n  	Crossing threads is necessary when the process you are tracking splits workamong multiple threads
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 3: Cross Threads  O log n  	The complexity here depends on both what you consider asingle task  e.g., processing a query  and how that work is split among threads.
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-crosser.h"	//  You don't need to #include the header for your instrumentation class here
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-crosser.h"	// This function already exists in your code, and parallelizes some// functionality that needs to use the instrumentation, but doesn't need to use// the instrumentation itself.void ParallelizeWork   {  // Previously, the code just created a thread
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-crosser.h"	 // std::thread worker &MyExistingFunction ;  // WrapCall when passing work to a worker thread, e.g., a thread pool
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	#include "thread-crosser.h"	 std::thread worker   worker.join  ;
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	Your instrumentation must have default behavior that makes sense when theinstrumentation is not enabled
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	Instrumentation can only be enabled byinstantiating the implementation, and will only be available until that instancegoes out of scope
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	There should be *very fewusually just one per instrumentation type  in your code.// #include the header for your instrumentation class.int main   {  // If no instrumentation is in scope, the default behavior of the static API  // is used where instrumentation calls are made
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	In this case, this will just  // print the line to std::cerr
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	 ParallelizeWork  ;  // instantiate your class
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	The framework will take care of the rest
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	 Logger logger;  // rather than the default behavior of printing to std::cerr
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	 ParallelizeWork  ;  // the local instance
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	 for  const std::string& line : logger.GetLines    {  }The instantiation point will depend on the semantics you are going for
google-readmegoogle-capture-thread.md	Step 4: Enable Instrumentation  O 1  	Forexample, if you are mocking, you might only instantiate the instrumentation inunit tests, and use the default behavior in the released code.

google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	cargo-raze: Bazel BUILD generation for Rust Crates	  An experimental support Cargo plugin for distilling a workspace-levelCargo.toml into BUILD targets that code using  rules_rust can depend on directly.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Disclaimer	This is not an official Google product  experimental or otherwise , it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Overview	This project synthesizes the dependency resolution logic and some of thefunctionality of Cargo such as features and build scripts into executablerules that Bazel can run to compile Rust crates
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Overview	Though the standard rules_rustrules can be used to compile Rust code from scratch, the fine granularity of thedependency ecosystem makes transforming dependency trees based on that ecosystemonerous, even for code with few dependencies.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Usage	cargo-raze can generate buildable targets in one of two modes: Vendoring, orNon-Vendoring
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Usage	In the vendoring mode, developers use the common cargo-vendortool to retrieve the dependencies indicated by their workspace Cargo.toml intodirectories that cargo-raze then populates with BUILD files
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Usage	In thenon-vendoring mode, cargo-raze generates a flat list of BUILD files, and aworkspace-level macro that can be invoked in the WORKSPACE file to pull down thedependencies automatically in similar fashion to Cargo itself.In both cases, the first step is to decide where to situate the Cargodependencies in the workspace
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Usage	This library was designed with monorepos in mind,where an organization decides upon a set of dependencies that everyone pointsat
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Usage	It is intended that stakeholders in the dependencies collaborate to upgradedependencies atomically, and fix breakages across their codebase simultaneously.In the event that this isn't feasible, it is still possible to use cargo-raze ina decentralized scenario, but its unlikely that such decoupled repositorieswould interact well together with the current implementation.Regardless of the approach chosen, the rust_rules should be brought in to theWORKSPACE
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Usage	Here is an example:git_repository  load "@io_bazel_rules_rust//rust:repositories.bzl", "rust_repositories" rust_repositories  
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Vendoring Mode	In Vendoring mode, a root directly is selected that will house the vendoreddependencies and become the gateway to those build rules
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Vendoring Mode	"//cargo" isconventional, but "//third_party/cargo" may be desirable to satisfyorganizational needs
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Vendoring Mode	Vendoring directly into root isn't well supported due toimplementation-specific idiosyncracies, but it may be supported in the future.From here forward, "//cargo" will be the assumed directory.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Generate a Cargo.toml	Generate a Cargo.toml, similar to Vendoring mode but add a new directive in theThis tells Raze not to expect the dependencies to be vendored and to generatedifferent files.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Mandatory  or Cargo tooling is unhappy 	 lib path = "fake_lib.rs" dependencies log = "=0.3.6" raze 
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	The WORKSPACE relative path to the Cargo.toml working directory.	workspace_path = "//cargo"
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	The target to generate BUILD rules for.	target = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Generate buildable targets	First, install cargo-raze.Next, execute cargo raze from within the cargo directoryFinally, invoke the remote library fetching function within your WORKSPACE:load "//cargo:crates.bzl", "raze_fetch_remote_crates" raze_fetch_remote_crates  This tells Bazel where to get the dependencies from, and how to build them:using the files generated into //cargo.You can depend on any *explicit
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Remote Dependency Mode	In Remote mode a directory similiar to the vendoring mode is selected
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Remote Dependency Mode	In thiscase though it contains only BUILD files, a vendoring instruction for the WORKSPACE,and aliases to the explicit dependencies
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Remote Dependency Mode	Slightly different plumbing is
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Handling Unconventional Crates	Some crates execute a "build script", which, while technically unrestricted inwhat it can do, usually does one of a few common things.All options noted below are enumerated in the src/settings.rs  ./src/settings.rs  file.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that generate files using locally known information	In some cases, a crate uses only basic information in order to generate a Rustsource file
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that generate files using locally known information	These build-scripts rules can actually be executed and used withinBazel by including a directive in your Cargo.toml prior to generation:script and to direct its generated  OUT_DIR-style  outputs to the parent crate.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	Some build scripts conditionally emit directives to stdout that Cargo knows howto propagate
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	Unfortunately, its not so simple to manage build-time generateddependency information, so if the flags are statically known  perhaps, since thecompilation target is statically known , they can be provided from within theCargo.toml, in the following mannerFlags provided in this manner are directly handed to rustc
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	It may be helpful torefer to the build-script section of the documentation to interpret buildscripts and stdout directives that are encountered, available here:There are two ways to provide system libraries that a crate needs forcompilation
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	The first is to vendor the system library directly, craft a BUILDrule for it, and add the dependency to the corresponding toml raze.crates.openssl-sys.'0.9.24' additional_flags =    # Vendored openssl is 1.0.2m  "--cfg=ossl102",  "--cfg=version=102", additional_deps =    "@//third_party/openssl:crypto",  "@//third_party/openssl:ssl",  raze.crates.openssl.'0.10.2' additional_flags =    # Vendored openssl is 1.0.2m  "--cfg=ossl102",  "--cfg=version=102",  "--cfg=ossl10x", In some cases, directly wiring up a local system dependency may be preferable.To do this, refer to the In a few cases, the sys crate may need to be overridden entirely
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	This can befacilitated by removing and supplementing dependencies in the Cargo.toml, Some crates provide useful binaries that themselves can be used as part of acompilation process: Bindgen is a great example
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	Bindgen produces Rust sourcefiles by processing C or C++ files
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Crates that depend on certain flags being determined by a build script	A directive can be added to the Cargo.tomlto tell Bazel to expose such binaries for you:binaries and libraries to share the same target name, Bazel disallows this.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why choose Bazel to build a Rust project?	Bazel  "fast", "correct", choose two  is a battle tested build system used byGoogle to compile incredibly large, multilingual projects without duplicatingeffort, and without compromising on correctness
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why choose Bazel to build a Rust project?	It accomplishes this in part bylimiting what mechanisms a given compilation object can use to discoverdependencies and by forcing buildable units to express the complete set oftheir dependencies
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why choose Bazel to build a Rust project?	It expects two identical sets of build target inputs to produce abyte-for-byte equivalent final result.In exchange, users are rewarded with a customizable and extensible build systemthat compiles any kind of compilable target and allows expressing "unconventionaldependencies", such as Protobuf objects, precompiled graphics shaders, orgenerated code, while remaining fast and correct.Its also probable  though not yet demonstrated with benchmarks  that largeapplications built with Bazel's strengths in mind: highly granular build units,will compile significantly faster as they are able to cache more aggressivelyand avoid recompilation of as much code while iterating.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why try to integrate Cargo's dependencies into this build tool?	For better or worse, the Rust ecosystem heavily depends on Cargo crates in orderto provide functionality that is often present in standard libraries
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why try to integrate Cargo's dependencies into this build tool?	This isactually a fantastic thing for the evolution of the language, as it describes astructured process to stabilization  experimental crate -> 1.0 crate -> RFC ->inclusion in stdlib , but it means that people who lack access to this ecosystemmust reinvent many wheels.Putting that aside there are also fantastic crates that help Rust developersinteract with industry standard systems and libraries which can greatlyaccelerate development in the language.
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why not build directly with Cargo / Why generate rustc invocations?	Though the burden of emulating Cargo's functionality  where possible at all!  ishigh, it appears to be the only way to maintain the guarantees  correctness,reproducibility  that Bazel depends on to stay performant
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	Why not build directly with Cargo / Why generate rustc invocations?	It is possible andlikely with inflight RFCs that Cargo will become sufficiently flexible toallow it to be used directly for compilation but at this point in time itappears that maintaining a semblance of feature parity is actually easier thanavoiding all of the sharp edges introduced by treating Cargo like the Rust
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	What is buildable right now with Bazel, and what is not?	With a little bit of elbow grease it is possible to build nearly everything,including projects that depend on openssl-sys
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	What is buildable right now with Bazel, and what is not?	Many sys crates will requireidentifying the system library that they wrap, and either vendoring it into theproject, or telling Bazel where it lives on your system
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	What is buildable right now with Bazel, and what is not?	Some may require minorsource tweaks, such as eliminating hardcoded cargo environment variablerequirements
google-readmegoogle-cargo-raze.md	What is buildable right now with Bazel, and what is not?	Fixes can be non-trivial in a few cases, but a good number ofthe most popular crates have been built in an example repo, available at

google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Overview	CCTZ contains two libraries that cooperate with  to give C++programmers all the necessary tools for computing with dates, times, and timezones in a simple and correct manner
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Overview	The libraries in CCTZ are:These libraries are currently known to work on **Linux**, **Mac OS X**, andThey will also work on **Windows*interested, though, in an implementation of the cctz::TimeZoneIf interface thatcalls the Windows time APIs instead
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Overview	Please contact us if you're interested in
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	CCTZ is best built and tested using the  Bazel  build systemand the  Google Test  framework
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	 There isalso a simple  Makefile and a CMakeLists.txt that should work if you're unable to use Bazel
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	 Download/install Get the cctz source: git clone  then cd Build cctz and run the tests: bazel test :allWith CMake: Make sure you have CMake >= 2.8.12 installed
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Get the cctz source: git clone  then cd Build cctz so that is can be used by shared libraries and run the tests  use Use in your CMake-based project with:Note: When using CCTZ in your own project, you might find it easiest to compilethe sources using your existing build system.Next Steps: See the documentation for the libraries in CCTZ: Look at the examples in  Join our mailing list to ask questions and keep informed of changes:* The concepts presented here describe general truths about the problem domainand are library and language agnostic
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	An understanding of these concepts helpsthe programmer correctly reason about even the most-complicated time-programmingchallenges and produce the simplest possible solutions
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	*There are two main ways to think about time in a computer program: as *absolutetime*, and as *civil time*
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Both have their uses and it is important tounderstand when each is appropriate
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Absolute and civil times may be convertedback and forth using a *time zoneconvert between them
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Let us now look more deeply at the three main concepts oftime programming: Absolute Time, Civil Time, and Time Zone.*Absolute timeIt has no notion of calendars, or dates, or times of day
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Instead, it is ameasure of the passage of real time, typically as a simple count of ticks sincesome epoch
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Absolute times are independent of all time zones and do not sufferfrom human-imposed complexities such as daylight-saving time  DST 
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Many C++types exist to represent absolute times, classically std::chrono::time_point.*Civil timeaffairs  cf
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	 It is ahuman-scale representation of time that consists of the six fields &mdash; year,month, day, hour, minute, and second  sometimes shortened to "YMDHMS"  &mdash;and it follows the rules of the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar, with 24-hour daysdivided into 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Like absolute times, civiltimes are also independent of all time zones and their related complexities e.g., DST 
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	While std::tm contains the six civil-time fields  YMDHMS , plus afew more, it does not have behavior to enforce the rules of civil time.*Time zonesshared to convert between the absolute-time and civil-time domains
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	A timezone's rules include things like the region's offset from the UTC time standard,daylight-saving adjustments, and short abbreviation strings
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	Time zones oftenhave a history of disparate rules that apply only for certain periods, becausethe rules may change at the whim of a region's local government
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	For thisreason, time-zone rules are usually compiled into data snapshots that are usedat runtime to perform conversions between absolute and civil times
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	There iscurrently no C++ standard library supporting arbitrary time zones.In order for programmers to reason about and program applications that correctlydeal with these concepts, they must have a library that correctly implements theabove concepts
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Getting Started	CCTZ adds to the existing C++11  library to fullyimplement the above concepts.
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Hello February 2016	This "hello world" example uses a for-loop to iterate the days from the first ofFebruary until the month of March
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	Hello February 2016	Each day is streamed to output, and if theday happens to be the 29th, we also output the day of the week.
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	#include "cctz/time_zone.h"	int main   {  cctz::time_zone nyc;  cctz::load_time_zone "America/New_York", &nyc ;  const auto moon_walk =  if  !cctz::load_time_zone "Australia/Sydney", &syd   return -1;  std::cout << "Moon walk in SYD: "The output of the above program isfirst walk on the moon is the same no matter the time zone of the viewer  thesame time point is used in both calls to format   
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	#include "cctz/time_zone.h"	The only difference is thetime zone in which the moon_walk time point is rendered
google-readmegoogle-cctz.md	#include "cctz/time_zone.h"	And in this case wecan see that our friend in Sydney was probably eating lunch while watching thathistoric event.

google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Requirements	Python 2.7
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	TODO barkimedes : Describe installation in more detail
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	This is just a generalrecommendation for people who already know how to download code from GitHub.The following is a very simple Checkers test:import checkersfrom checkers import assertsfrom checkers.runners import pyunitdef test_add_2_2_4  :  asserts.are_equal 2 + 2, 4 def test_add_4_8_12  :  asserts.are_equal 4 + 8, 12 def test_divide_2_0_error  :  with asserts.expect_exception ZeroDivisionError :if __name__ == '__main__':  pyunit.main  Remember when we mentioned that tests are composed of several parts? Well, acouple of them are evidenced here.First, a test must have some test steps
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	Consider this the test logic
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	WithCheckers, this is indicated by functions that are decorated with@checkers.test
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	Each of these functions becomes a checkers.Test instance.Secondly, we must have a test runner
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	Checkers tests can be run by anything thatknows how to deal with checkers.TestRun s , but a test runner that isdistributed with Checkers is the PyUnit runner
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	This is used in the mainfunction here
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Installation	 By default, the runner will include all of the tests in themodule containing main .
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	Tests are always placed into test runs  checkers.TestRun instances 
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	In theabove example, the test run was created automatically by the pyunit.mainfunction
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	But if you want to do anything interesting, you'll probably need tocreate and manage your test runs directly.The test run allows you to provide lots of things to the test
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	You can registersetup and teardown functions  at the test run level, setup will run oncebefore all of the tests and then teardown will run once after all of the testsare complete 
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	You can also define test suite for organizing test cases
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	You canadd tests directly to the test run from wherever you like
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	You can registercomponents to be injected into the test cases
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	Here is a more interesting testcase that does a few of those things:Before we get too fancy, let's see the above example where we explicitly createthe test run:import checkersfrom checkers import assertsfrom checkers.runners import pyunitdef test_add_2_2_4  :  asserts.are_equal 2 + 2, 4 def test_add_4_8_12  :  asserts.are_equal 4 + 8, 12 def create_test_run  :  test_run = checkers.TestRun    test_run.tests.register test_add_2_2_4   rest_run.tests.register test_add_4_8_12   # You can also load tests by module so you don't have to register each test
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Defining Test Runs	 # If module_name isn't provided, it defaults to '__main__'  # test_run = checkers.TestRun.from_module module_name=__name__   return test_runif __name__ == '__main__':  pyunit.main test_run=create_test_run   
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Injecting Components	Now that we know how to create a test run, let's see how component injectionImagine we have a Calculator class that is the component-under-test and wewant to inject it into the tests
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Injecting Components	Calculator is defined in the calculator.pymodule as follows:class Calculator object :Exciting, right? Now let's take our original two tests and update them to usethe calculator to do the adding.import calculatorimport checkersfrom checkers import assertsfrom checkers.runners import pyunitdef test_add_2_2_4 calculator :  asserts.are_equal calculator.add 2, 2 , 4 def test_add_4_8_12 calculator :  asserts.are_equal calculator.add 4, 8 , 12 def create_test_run  :  test_run = checkers.TestRun.from_module    test_run.variables.register 'calculator', calculator.Calculator   return test_runif __name__ == '__main__':  pyunit.main test_run=create_test_run   Tests can take in arguments
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Injecting Components	In the above example, the tests take in acalculator argument
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Injecting Components	These arguments are referred to as 'variables' inCheckers
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Injecting Components	So if you want all of the tests in a test run to have access to aparticular variable and value  in this case, a Calculator instance , thenjust register it with the test run variables and Checkers will inject it for youwhen the test runs.
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Data-Driven  Parameterized  Tests	Test variables don't just have to be components under test
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Data-Driven  Parameterized  Tests	There is anothermechanism for passing values into tests: parameterization
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Data-Driven  Parameterized  Tests	And good news!! It'sbuilt natively into Checkers, so it works pretty well : There are two ways that you can parameterize a test
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Data-Driven  Parameterized  Tests	One way is through the@checkers.parameterize decorator
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Data-Driven  Parameterized  Tests	The other way is to register theparameterizations through the test run
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Data-Driven  Parameterized  Tests	Hopefully this isn't too confusing, buttest run-based parameterizations are a useful feature because sometimes aparmeterization is only  useful in certain circumstances/under certainconfigurations, and this allows us to not *alwaysapplied to test cases  which is the case when decorators alone provide thisfunctionality .Anywho, the following example shows both ways of adding parameterizations:import checkersfrom checkers import assertsfrom checkers.runners import pyunitimport calculator as calcdef test_add calculator, x, y, expected :  asserts.are_equal calculator.add x, y , expected   print '%d + %d = %d' %  x, y, expected 
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	test is used in a test run. Use with caution!	@checkers.parameterize {} @checkers.test_suites 'subtract' def test_subtract calculator, x, y, expected :  asserts.are_equal calculator.subtract x, y , expected   print '%d
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	sort. This provides a built-in, flexible parameterization.	def build_add_params  :  return     def create_test_run  :  test_run = checkers.TestRun.from_module    test_run.variables.register 'calculator', calc.Calculator     # The parameterizations are applied at the test run level, so they only apply  # to this test run
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	sort. This provides a built-in, flexible parameterization.	 # You should prefer this mechanism for creating parameterizations that may be  # dependent on the environment, that you have to load data from another  # location  like a database , or where the components under test may behave  # differently from each other so the parameters would have to change between  # test runs
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	sort. This provides a built-in, flexible parameterization.	 for param in build_add_params  :  return test_runif __name__ == '__main__':  pyunit.main test_run=create_test_run   The output of running the above test is the following:Running tests under Python 2.7.6: /path/to/python2.7---------------------------------------------------------------------1 + 1 = 22 + 2 = 44 + 8 = 122 + -1 = 18 0 Note that components and parameter values are both just variables
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	sort. This provides a built-in, flexible parameterization.	Sofunctionally, it is entirely possible to include a component in aparameterization  and vice versa 
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	sort. This provides a built-in, flexible parameterization.	But conceptually, you probably want to makesure that you're keeping the two straight.
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Fixtures	Checkers supports fixtures at the test run and test case levels
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Fixtures	If you haveteardown functions that you want to run before or after each individual testcase, then you can use the @checkers.setup and @checkers.teardown decoratorson tests themselves, or register them with the test run.Note that test run-level fixtures will take in an optional parameter: thecheckers.Context instance.The cool thing about Checkers fixtures is that you can have as many or as fewas you like, and they can be defined as functions with names that actuallymake sense and can be shared
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Fixtures	 In general, Checkers is very friendly to mixingand matching things however you like
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Fixtures	There is a special variable in Checkers that is available to any test function.The context variable will always contain a checkers.Context instance, whichcontains information about the test run, the test case itself, etc
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Fixtures	You'll seethat in this example, too.def logging_test_run_setup test_run :  print '#'def logging_test_run_teardown test_run :  print 'Finishing test run:', test_run.name  print '#' def register_calculator context :  calc = Calculator    print 'Registering calculator:', context.test_case.name, calc.__class__  context.variables.register 'calculator', calc def logging_test_case_setup context :  print '*'def logging_test_case_teardown context :  print 'Finishing test case:', context.test_case.full_name  print '*' def celebrate_evenness context :  print 'Awesome!! %s only has even numbers!!' % context.test_case.namedef curse_oddness context :  print 'Phooey!! %s has odd numbers :P' % context.test_case.namedef zero_division_setup  :  print 'Oops, dividing by zero in this test'@checkers.setup celebrate_evenness, zero_division_setup def test_divide_2_0  :  with asserts.expect_exception ZeroDivisionError :@checkers.teardown curse_oddness def test_add_1_1_2 calculator :  asserts.are_equal calculator.add 2, 2 , 4   print '1 + 1 = 2'@checkers.setup celebrate_evenness def test_add_2_2_4 calculator :  asserts.are_equal calculator.add 2, 2 , 4   print '2 + 2 = 4'@checkers.setup celebrate_evenness def test_add_4_8_12 calculator :  asserts.are_equal calculator.add 4, 8 , 12   print '4 + 8 = 12'def create_test_run  :  test_run = checkers.TestRun.from_module    test_run.setup.register logging_test_run_setup   test_run.teardown.register logging_test_run_teardown   test_run.test_case_setup.register logging_test_case_setup   test_run.test_case_setup.register register_calculator   test_run.test_case_teardown.register logging_test_case_teardown   return test_runif __name__ == '__main__':  pyunit.main test_run=create_test_run   The output for the above test run would be as follows:
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	################################################################################	Running tests under Python 2.7.6: /path/to/python2.7---------------------------------------------------------------------
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	Checkers makes it easy to organize your tests in a flexible, fluid kind of way.A nice aspect of Checkers is that you can use test suites to organize tests
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	Aneven nicer aspect is that the same test can be part of muliple test suites!!This can be really cool if you either have multiple ways that you want to viewtest results  perhaps one view is by module and another view is by feature 
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	Itcan also be helpful if you want the same test to be part of multiple suites like if tests are grouped by feature and this is an integration test thatcovers multiple features 
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	The nicest feature about using test suites is that,even if a test is used in multiple suites, it is only run once  assuming thetest runner that you're using is well-implemented, of course .I take that back
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	The *nicestdistribute your test definitions cleanly in various modules and use suites tobring them together in test runs in ways that make sense.You can assign tests to test suites in a few ways
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	One way is through thecheckers.TestSuite instance and register the whole suite with the test run.You can just register a test directly in the test run
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	Lastly, you can add avariable to a parameterization called 'test_suites' that has a list of suitenames that only that parameterization should apply to
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	Let's see all of theseoptions below.Imagine we've defined some subtraction tests in a separate module.import checkersfrom checkers import asserts@checkers.parameterize {} def test_subtract x, y, expected :  return asserts.are_equal x And in our main module, we can see all of the different ways that test suitescan be defined  decorator, part of a parameterization, registered with the testrun, or as individual tests registered with the test run .import checkersfrom checkers import assertsfrom checkers.runners import pyunitimport subtraction_tests@checkers.test_suites 'addition', 'multiplication' @checkers.parameterize {} def test_double x, expected :  asserts.are_equal x + x, expected   asserts.are_equal x @checkers.parameterize {} def test_add x, y, expected :  asserts.are_equal x + y, expected def create_test_run  :  test_run = checkers.TestRun.from_module    test_run.test_suites 'addition' .register test_add   subtraction_suite = checkers.TestSuite.from_module subtraction_tests   test_run.test_suites.register subtraction_suite   return test_runif __name__ == '__main__':  pyunit.main test_run=create_test_run   If you ran that code, you'd see that 24 tests were run
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	In reality, only 9 testswere *actuallysome tests are in multiple suites, it is reported as 24 tests
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Organization	If nothing else,you can use Checkers to grossly inflate your metrics and impress folks with yourprolific test authoring!! :smiling_imp:
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Asserts Module  checkers.asserts 	You can use any assert engine for doing asserts, from using the assertstatement directly to using a full-blown matching framework like PyHamcrest  Checkers comes with a fewbuilt-in asserters in the checkers.asserts module.Assert | Example | Descriptionhas_length | asserts.has_length 'hello', 5  | asserts that the given iterable has the expected length
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Runners  checkers.runners.pyunit 	The included test runner in the package is the PyUnit runner
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Runners  checkers.runners.pyunit 	This will run theCheckers tests *in addition to any other existing unittest-based tests.pyunit.main function will call unittest.main, and pass through any providedargs, so it is very easy to integrate Checkers into existing test environments.As mentioned previously, tests are always stored in test runs in Checkers
google-readmegoogle-checkers.md	Test Runners  checkers.runners.pyunit 	Soany test runner can be used that takes in test run s  and executes them.

google-readmegoogle-chrome-tabber.md	What does Chrome Tabber Do?	Chrome Tabber allows you to share your browser tabs across devices very simply,using your Google account.By default, when you open the Chrome browser, the tabs are initialized to thesame state as when you closed the browser *on that device.*Although there is a setting that lets you change that behavior, you cannoteasily restore tabs from another device
google-readmegoogle-chrome-tabber.md	What does Chrome Tabber Do?	The official way to do that in Chromeis to save your current tabs as a group bookmark  *"Bookmark Open Pages..."* and then open that bookmark on another device.Chrome Tabber lets you instantly sync your tabs across Chrome browsers on anydevice logged into your Google account
google-readmegoogle-chrome-tabber.md	What does Chrome Tabber Do?	It provides several modes of operationso you can customize this behavior to fit your needs.
google-readmegoogle-chrome-tabber.md	How to use Chrome Tabber	After installing Chrome Tabber it will display a little icon in Chrome'sextension icon area  typically the upper right of the browser 
google-readmegoogle-chrome-tabber.md	How to use Chrome Tabber	Click this iconin order see Chrome Tabber's popup UI.On Tabber's popup, you can see status, perform manual syncing, or change themode of operation
google-readmegoogle-chrome-tabber.md	How to use Chrome Tabber	The mode of operation is persistent, and applies to the*current devicedevices  which is a useful and typical way to set up your devices .

google-readmegoogle-ci_edit.md	Origins	I found that I was often trying totweak them to get just what I wanted
google-readmegoogle-ci_edit.md	Origins	Almost as often, some aspect of thoseeditors prevented that last little bit of customization
google-readmegoogle-ci_edit.md	Origins	So writing a texteditor should allow all the customization I like, right?Writing a text editor is an interesting project
google-readmegoogle-ci_edit.md	Origins	Give it a try sometime.

google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Summary	Cloud Integration Testing Framework  citest  is a python package to facilitatewriting integration tests against the REST style APIs typically used bycloud services.The gist is to allow tests to be written using a literary programming stylewhere the core framework accommodates for asynchronous calls and even retriesif appropriate.
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Setup	pip install -r requirements.txt
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Example	A test case might look something like this:  def create_google_load_balancer self :Where the test can be executed like this:
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	Integration tests are written against services by sending an operation tothe service then observing the effects of that operation and verifying themagainst expectations.citest introduces a BaseAgent class for adapting external servicesto the framework where the agent is responsible for understanding thetransport and protocol for exchanging messages with the service
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	It introducessome basic concrete types such as HttpAgent and CliAgent where the primarymeans is HTTP messaging or running a command-line program
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	Specific systemsmay need to further specialize these to understand any additional applicationprotocols added, such as status responses for asynchronous HTTP messaging.BaseAgent also acts as an AgentOperation factory where the operationsprovide a means to wrap these service calls as first-class objects understoodby the core citest framework
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	This allows citest to invoke  or reinvoke the operation when it is appropriate to do so, rather than when the static codeis specifying what the test will be
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	When executed, the AgentOperation willcreate an OperationStatus allowing citest to track its progress andeventual result.In order to verify the operation, citest uses Contract objects
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	A contractis a collection of ContractClause where each clause can look for differenteffects
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	A ContractClause is typically composed of an observation on theeffects and an assertion about what is expected to be observed
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	The observationis made by an Observer that collects data in an Observation by working witha BaseAgent to collect the data  e.g
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	an HTTP GET on someJSON resource 
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	The assertion is made by looking for expected values andpatterns in the collected resources
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	Each clause can collect differentThe assertions are written using specialized ValuePredicate objects, whichare python callable classes that take the object value to be validate and returna PredicateResult containing the conclusion and justification for it.When a test is run, it will provide a trace of the operations performed,data collected and justifications as to why it thinks the collected datameets or does not meet expectations, ultimately passing or failing the test.SubPackage | Purposejson_contract | Introduces a means to specify observers to collect JSON documents, and to define contracts specifying expectations of the collected JSON content.json_predicate | Introduces a means to locate and attributes within JSON objects, and compare their values
google-readmegoogle-citest.md	Abstract Model	These are used as the basis of json_contract.service_testing | Introduces the core framework, base classes, and generic utilities.aws_testing | Specializations and extensions to support testing on Amazon Web Services  AWS gcp_testing | Specializations and extensions to support testing on Google Cloud Platform  GCP openstack_testing | Specializations and extensions to support testing on OpenStackazure_testing | Specializations and extensions to support testing on Microsoft Azure  AZ tests | Tests for this package

google-readmegoogle-cld3.md	Compact Language Detector v3  CLD3 	This package contains the inference code and a trained model
google-readmegoogle-cld3.md	Compact Language Detector v3  CLD3 	The inference code extracts character ngrams from the input text and computes the fraction of times each of them appears
google-readmegoogle-cld3.md	Compact Language Detector v3  CLD3 	For example, as shown in the figure below, if the input text is "banana", then one of the extracted trigrams is "ana" and the corresponding fraction is 2/The ngrams are hashed down to an id within a small range, and each id is represented by a dense embedding vector estimated during training.The model averages the embeddings corresponding to each ngram type according to the fractions, and the averaged embeddings are concatenated to produce the embedding layer
google-readmegoogle-cld3.md	Compact Language Detector v3  CLD3 	The remaining components of the network are a hidden  Rectified linear  layer and a softmax layer.To get a language prediction for the input text, we simply perform a forward pass through the network.! Figure  model.png "CLD3"

google-readmegoogle-clif.md	C++ Language Interface Foundation  CLIF 	CLIF provides a common foundation for creating C++ wrapper generators forvarious languages.
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Overview	It consists of four parts:  Matcher  Generator  Runtime
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Parser	The parser converts a language-friendly C++ API description to thelanguage-agnostic internal format and passes it to the Matcher.
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Matcher	The matcher parses selected C++ headers with Clang  LLVM's C++ compiler  andcollects type information
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Matcher	 That info is passed to the Generator.
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Generator	The generator emits C++ source code for the wrapper.The generated wrapper needs to be built according with language extension rules.Usually that wrapper will call into the Runtime.
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Runtime	The runtime C++ library holds type conversion routines that are specific toeach target language but are the same for every generated wrapper.
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Python CLIF	See complete implementation of a Python wrapper generator in the /python/subdirectory
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Python CLIF	 Both Python 2 and 3 are supported.
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Prerequisites	 We use  CMake  so make sure CMake We use Google You must have  virtualenv  You must have Subversion installed, so we can fetch LLVM
google-readmegoogle-clif.md	Prerequisites	You must have pyparsing installed, so we can build protobuf

google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	clojure-turtle	clojure-turtle is a Clojure library that implements the Logo programming language in a Clojure context
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	clojure-turtle	  Quil  is used for rendering.Logo is a simple language that is useful in introducing programming to beginners, especially young ones
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	clojure-turtle	 Logo also happens to be a dialect of Lisp
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	clojure-turtle	 clojure-turtle tries to maintain those beneficial aspects of Logo while using Clojure and Clojure syntax
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	clojure-turtle	 The goal is to make learning programming and/or Clojure easier by disguising powerful concepts with fun!
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	Artifacts	clojure-turtle artifacts are  released to Clojars If you are using Maven, add the following repository definition to your pom.xml:With Leiningen:First,  install Leiningen Second, run a REPL session that has clojure-turtle loaded inside it
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	Artifacts	 This can be done in a couple of ways:Load the clojure-turtle.core namespace.The symbol repeat is overridden to behave more like the Logo function, but the Clojure core function is still available as clojure.core/repeat.Now load a new window that shows our Quil sketch using the new-window form
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	Artifacts	The sketch is where our turtle lives and operates.
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	forward, back, right, left	It's forward, back, right, and left as in Logo
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	forward, back, right, left	 Go forward and back by a length  in pixels 
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	forward, back, right, left	 Right and left turn the turtle by an angle, in degrees
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	forward, back, right, left	 It's Clojure syntax, so 'executing commands'  function calls  are done within parentheses.
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	repeat, all	repeat is like the Logo function, or like Clojure's repeatedly
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	repeat, all	 Going from the Logo syntax to clojure-turtle's syntax for repeat, commands that are being repeated are put within parentheses notation
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	repeat, all	 The square brackets that group the repeated commands are replaced with  all ..

google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	The turtle sprite  the triangle representing the turtle  will be drawnin the same color as the turtle's pen.We can also use our color value to fill the interior of shapes that wedraw
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 To draw shapes will a fill color, we first have to indicatewhen we start and when we end drawing the shape
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 For that, we use thestart-fill and end-fill commands
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 Every line segment that the turtledraws in between start-fill and end-fill is assumed to form theperimeter of the shape.Let us define filled-octagon as the combination of commands to draw a filledoctagon
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 In between the start-fill and end-fill that demarcate ourfill shape, we will use our octagon function to draw the perimeter of theoctagon that we want filled.as the "alpha" value
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 In clojure-turtle, the alpha value is also aninteger that ranges from 0 to  The value 0 represents fulltransparency, and 255 represents full opacity.overlap, so we will create a points vector of 4 x,y-coordinates fromwhich we will start drawingeach octagon.set our position to that first point, and then draw our first octagonfrom there
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	let  point-1  first points    setxy x y    filled-octagon    Next, we will draw our the remaining 3 octagons
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 Since we willperform similar actions in repetition, let's create a function tostore the behavior we want to repeat.!  A color vector of size 1 creates a grayscale color ranging from blackto white
google-readmegoogle-clojure-turtle.md	color	 The grayscalecolor is equivalent to using a 3-element RGB color vector where thevalues for red, green, and blue are the same.

google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-js.md	Webpack	Your webpack.config.js should look like this:const ClosureCompiler = require 'google-closure-compiler-js' .webpack;const path = require 'path' ;module.exports = {  entry:     ,  output: {  },  plugins:     
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-js.md	Gulp	Your gulpfile.js should contain a task like this:const compiler = require 'google-closure-compiler-js' .gulp  ;gulp.task 'script', function   {  return gulp.src './path/to/src.js', {base: './'} } ;

google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	google-closure-compiler	    ! npm version  Check, compile, optimize and compress Javascript with Closure-CompilerThis repository tracks issues related to the publication to npmjs.org and associated plugins.Any bugs not related to the plugins themselves should be reported to the main repository 
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Getting Started	If you are new to  Closure-Compiler  makesure to read and understand the compilation levels  asthe compiler works very differently depending on the compilation level selected.For help or questions with the compiler, the best resource is Stack Overflow  Posts thereare monitored by multiple Closure Compiler team members.You may also post in the Closure Compiler Discuss Google Group *Please don't cross post to both Stackoverflow and Closure Compiler Discuss.*The compiler is distributed as a Java jar and a JavaScript library
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Getting Started	Mac OS and Linux also have native binaries.
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Native Binary Version	On Mac OS or Linux, optional dependencies will install a native binary of the compiler.Native binaries offer faster compile times without requiring Java to be installed and available.Compilations with a very large number of source files may be slightly slower than the java version.
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Java Version	const ClosureCompiler = require 'google-closure-compiler' .compiler;console.log ClosureCompiler.COMPILER_PATH ; // absolute path the compiler jarconsole.log ClosureCompiler.CONTRIB_PATH ; // absolute path the contrib folder which containsconst closureCompiler = new ClosureCompiler {  js: 'file-one.js',  compilation_level: 'ADVANCED'} ;const compilerProcess = closureCompiler.run  exitCode, stdOut, stdErr  => {  //compilation complete} ;
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	JavaScript Version	const ClosureCompiler = require 'google-closure-compiler' .jsCompiler;console.log ClosureCompiler.CONTRIB_PATH ; // absolute path the contrib folder which containsconst closureCompiler = new ClosureCompiler {  compilation_level: 'ADVANCED'} ;const compilerProcess = closureCompiler.run  { path: 'file-one.js', src: 'alert "hello world" ', sourceMap: null // optional input source map} ,  exitCode, stdOut, stdErr  => {  //compilation complete} ;
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Usage	The simplest way to invoke the compiler  e.g
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Usage	if you're just trying it out  is with  npx The npx version will attempt to detect the best platform to use
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Usage	You can also specify the platformwith the special --platform flag.
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Installation	See the  full list of compiler flags The build tool plugins take options objects
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Installation	The option parameters map directly to thecompiler flags without the leading '--' characters
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Installation	You may also use camelCase option names.Values are either strings or booleans
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Installation	Options which have multiple values can be arrays.than passing the string on to the compiler
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Installation	To prevent this it is necessary to quotecertain arguments:The compiler package also includes build tool plugins for  Grunt  and  Gulp  There is also an  official webpack plugin Additionally, community members have created plugins leveraging this library.
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Changing the Path to the Java SDK	Override the path before first use.const Compiler = require 'google-closure-compiler' ;Compiler.prototype.javaPath = '/node_modules/MODULE_NAME/jre/jre1.8.0_131.jre/Contents/Home/bin/java';const compiler = new Compiler {args} ;
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Running the compiler using nailgun	*Note: nailgun users are encouraged to try the native binary versions where available.*This gets around the long startup time of Google Closure Compiler using Nailgun  which runs a single java process in the backgroundand keeps all of the classes loaded.First you need to install closure-gun by running the following command.Then point the package to use closure-gun rather than the JDK.const compilerPackage = require 'google-closure-compiler' ;compilerPackage.compiler.JAR_PATH = undefined;compilerPackage.compiler.prototype.javaPath = './node_modules/.bin/closure-gun'Note that when using gulp, Only invocations without gulp.src work with nailgun.
google-readmegoogle-closure-compiler-npm.md	Native Node Usage  for Plugin Authors 	A low-level node class is included to facilitate spawning the compiler jar as a process from Node.In addition, it exposes a static property with the path to the compiler jar file.

google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Closure Stylesheets	Closure Stylesheets is an extension to CSS that adds** variables  #variables **, ** functions  #functions **,** conditionals  #conditionals **, and ** mixins  #mixins *CSS
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Closure Stylesheets	The tool also supports ** minification  #minification **,** linting  #linting **, ** RTL flipping  #rtl-flipping **, and CSS class** renaming  #renaming **.
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Get Closure Stylesheets!	Closure Stylesheets is available as a Java jar named closure-stylesheets.jar.You can either  download  a precompiled jar or  build it from source .Using Closure Stylesheets requires Java
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Get Closure Stylesheets!	To make sure that Java is installedcorrectly, try running the following command to print the list of command-lineoptions for Closure Stylesheets: build it from source :Internally at Google, Closure Stylesheets are frequently referred to as "GoogleStylesheets" or "GSS", so you will see references to GSS in the source code  Somedevelopers prefer to be explicit about which files use the Closure Stylesheetsextensions to CSS by using a **.gss*
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Variables	Variables can be defined in Closure Stylesheets using **@def*variable name and then a value
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Variables	Variables can also be defined in terms of othervariables
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Variables	Consider the following file, **variable-example.gss**:@def BG_COLOR@def DIALOG_BORDER_COLOR   rgb 107, 144, 218 ;@def DIALOG_BG_COLORbody {  background-color: BG_COLOR;.dialog {  background-color: DIALOG_BG_COLOR;  border: 1px solid DIALOG_BORDER_COLOR;Running **java -jar closure-stylesheets.jar --pretty-printClosure Stylesheets provides support for several arithmetic functions:purely numeric or CSS sizes with units  though add 3px, 5ex 
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Variables	Here is an example of when it might be helpful to use add  :@def LEFT_HAND_NAV_WIDTH@def LEFT_HAND_NAV_PADDING  3px;.left_hand_nav {  position: absolute;  width: LEFT_HAND_NAV_WIDTH;  padding: LEFT_HAND_NAV_PADDING;.content {  position: absolute;  margin-left: add LEFT_HAND_NAV_PADDING,  /Running **java -jar closure-stylesheets.jar --pretty-print CSS3 calc    because they do not allowyou to mix units as calc   does, they can still help produce more maintainableThere are also built-in functions that deal with colors
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Variables	For now, you need to see the code for details, but here are the functions and the arguments that they take:It is also possible to define your own functions in Java by implementing GssFunctionMapProvider and passing the fully-qualified class name to Closure Stylesheets via thelikely want to compose DefaultGssFunctionMapProvider so that your GssFunctionMapProvider provides your custom functions in addition to the built-in arithmetic functions.
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Mixins	Mixins make it possible to reuse a list of parameterized declarations
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Mixins	A mixindefinition  **@defmixin**  can be seen as a function with arguments thatcontains a list of declarations
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Mixins	At the place where a mixin is used **@mixin** , the values for the arguments are defined and the declarationsare inserted
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Mixins	A mixin can be used in any place where declarations are allowed.The names of the arguments in the **@defmixin*Global constants defined with **@def*mixins
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Mixins	They can be used both within the definition of a mixin, or as anargument when using a mixin.For example, consider defining a mixin in **mixin-simple-example.gss*could be used to create a shorthand for declaring the dimensions of an element:@defmixin size WIDTH, HEIGHT  {  width: WIDTH;  height: HEIGHT;.logo {  @mixin size 150px, 55px ;  background-image: url 'Running **java -jar closure-stylesheets.jar --pretty-printcross-browser behavior for styles such as gradients:@defmixin gradient POS, HSL1, HSL2, HSL3, COLOR, FALLBACK_COLOR  {  background-color: FALLBACK_COLOR; /  background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient POS, hsl HSL1, HSL2, HSL3 , COLOR ;  /  /  /.header {  @mixin gradient top, 0%, 50%, 70%, #cc0000, #f07575 ;The above is compiled to:

google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Additional Features	The Closure Stylesheets tool also offers some features that are not extensionsto CSS.
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Minification	You can concatenate and minify a list of stylesheets with the following command:to write the output to using the **--output-file***MOZILLA**, **OPERA**, **MICROSOFT**, and **KONQUEROR**
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Minification	When this flagis present, all vendor-specific properties for other vendors will be removed.
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Linting	Closure Stylesheets performs some static checks on your CSS
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	Linting	For example, itsmost basic function is to ensure that your CSS parses: if there are any parseerrors, Closure Stylesheets will print the errors to standard error and returnwith an exit code of 
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allowed-non-standard-function, --allow-unrecognized-functions	It will also error out when there are unrecognized function names or duplicatestyle declarations
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allowed-non-standard-function, --allow-unrecognized-functions	For example, if you ran Closure Stylesheets onUnknown function \"urel\" in linting-example.gss at line 4 column 21:  background-image: urel 'Detected multiple identical, non-alternate declarations in the same ruleset.If this is intentional please use the /border-color: rgba 0,0,0,0.1   in linting-example.gss at line 7 column 1:^2 error s In this particular case, the function urel   should have been url  , thoughif you are using a function that is not on the whitelist  see CssFunctionNode for the list of recognized functions, which is admittedly incomplete , then youcan specify **--allowed-non-standard-function*functions that should be whitelisted:It is also possible to disable the check for unknown functions altogether usingthe **--allow-unrecognized-functions*Further, in this example, the multiple declarations of border-color areintentional
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allowed-non-standard-function, --allow-unrecognized-functions	They are arranged so that user agents that recognize rgba   willuse the second declaration whereas those that do not will fall back on the firstdeclaration
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allowed-non-standard-function, --allow-unrecognized-functions	In order to suppress this error, use the /annotation that the error message suggests as follows:error
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allowed-non-standard-function, --allow-unrecognized-functions	It is also common to use this technique with multiple backgrounddeclarations that use -webkit-linear-gradient, -moz-linear-gradient, etc
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allowed-non-standard-function, --allow-unrecognized-functions	Ingeneral, using  conditionals  #Conditionals.md  to select the appropriatedeclaration based on user agent is preferred; however, that requires theadditional overhead of doing user agent detection and serving the appropriatestylesheet, so using the @alternate annotation is a simpler solution.
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allow-unrecognized-properties, --allowed-unrecognized-property	By default, Closure Stylesheets validates the names of CSS properties used in astylesheet
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allow-unrecognized-properties, --allowed-unrecognized-property	We have attempted to capture all legal properties in the hardcoded list of recognized properties that is bundled with Closure Stylesheets
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allow-unrecognized-properties, --allowed-unrecognized-property	However, you can allow properties thataren't in the list with the **--allowed-unrecognized-property*the file **bleeding-edge.gss**:-webkit-amp-volume is an unrecognized property in bleeding-edge.gss at line 3 column 3:  -webkit-amp-volume: 11;  ^1 error s You can whitelist -webkit-amp-volume with thespecified multiple times, once for each property to whitelist
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allow-unrecognized-properties, --allowed-unrecognized-property	We discourageusing the blanket --allow-unrecognized-properties because it lets througheverything, including simple spelling mistakes.Note that some recognized properties will emit warnings
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	--allow-unrecognized-properties, --allowed-unrecognized-property	These warnings will notbe silenced with the --allowed-unrecognized-property flag.
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	RTL Flipping	Closure Stylesheets has support for generating left-to-right  LTR  as well asright-to-left  RTL  stylesheets
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	RTL Flipping	By default, LTR is the assumed directionalityfor both the input and output, though those settings can be overridden byFor example, consider the following stylesheet, **rtl-example.gss**, which isdesigned for an LTR page:.logo {  margin-left: 10px;.shortcut_accelerator {  /  /  border-right:\t2px solid #ccc;  padding: 0 2px 0 4px;Generating the equivalent stylesheet to use on an RTL version of the page can beachieved by running **java -jar closure-stylesheets.jar --pretty-print--output-orientation RTL rtl-example.gss**, which prints:property instead of alongside it:Closure Stylesheets makes it possible to rename CSS class names in the generatedstylesheet, which helps reduce the size of the CSS that is sent down to yourusers
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	RTL Flipping	Of course, this is not particularly useful unless the class names arerenamed consistently in the HTML and JavaScript files that use theCSS
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	RTL Flipping	Fortunately, you can use the Closure Compiler  to update the classnames in your JavaScript and Closure Templates  to update theclass names in your HTML.To get the benefits of CSS renaming in Closure, instead of referencing a CSSclass name as a string literal, you must use that string literal as an argumentto goog.getCssName  : css command {namespace example} */{template .dialog}  {$title}  {call .content data=\"all\" /}When you generate the JavaScript for the template, be sure to use the--cssHandlingScheme GOOG option with SoyToJsSrcCompiler
google-readmegoogle-closure-stylesheets.md	RTL Flipping	This ensures thatthe generated JavaScript code will also use goog.getCssName

google-readmegoogle-cloud-berg.md	How does berg work?	The best way to understand berg is to just read the code  it's very small 
google-readmegoogle-cloud-berg.md	How does berg work?	Here’s an even shorter TLDR:Executing berg run  does the following:Helpful shortcuts  all of which are aliases for gcloud commands You can also use the gce web interface which allows filtering and bulk management of all of your instances.
google-readmegoogle-cloud-berg.md	Running a large scale job with MPI	This will start num_machines devboxes with 4 GPUs each
google-readmegoogle-cloud-berg.md	Running a large scale job with MPI	Then ssh into the first machine, and run mpi  to run your program across all machines using MPI

google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Cluster Insight: a context graph generator for Kubernetes clusters	Cluster Insight is a Kubernetes service that collects runtime metadata about resources in a Kubernetes cluster, and infers relationships between them to create a *context graph*.A context graph is a point-in-time snapshot of the cluster’s state
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Cluster Insight: a context graph generator for Kubernetes clusters	Clients of the Cluster Insight service, such as user interfaces, can retrieve context graphs through the service's REST API
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Cluster Insight: a context graph generator for Kubernetes clusters	Each call may produce a different context graph, reflecting the inherent dynamicity in the Kubernetes cluster.A context graph provides contextual information that can be combined with resource level monitoring data to enable visual navigation of the dynamic state of a Kubernetes cluster.The nodes of the context graph are cluster resources  cluster, nodes, services, replication controllers, pods, containers, and images , and the edges are the inferred relationships  contains, runs, monitors, loadBalances, createdFrom .
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	How to set up and access the service	Deploying Cluster Insight involves creating a service and a replication controller
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	How to set up and access the service	The replication controller creates one pod, which contains one container
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	How to set up and access the service	The container image is  here  on Docker Hub.
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Preliminaries	In the following, we will assume that you have a Kubernetes cluster running and kubectl configured to talk to it
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Preliminaries	If you have set up the Kubernetes cluster from the command line with gcloud container clusters create or kube-up.sh, then kubectl will have been configured for you
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Preliminaries	If you have set it up from the Google Developers Console, you can configure kubectl by running gcloud container clusters get-credentials.If you have several Kubernetes clusters configured, you can determine the corresponding *context names
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Setup	Assuming you have configured kubectl to talk to your Kubernetes cluster, deploying Cluster Insight is a simple matter of invoking kubectl create:
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Access	Cluster Insight provides detailed information about your cluster, including the values of environment variables, which many people use to inject secret credentials into containers
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Access	Access to its API needs to be restricted
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Access	An easy and safe way to access it is using kubectl proxy.Cluster Insight makes its REST API available through the cluster-insight service in the default namespace, on the named port cluster-insight
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Access	With kubectl proxy running, the help page for the API will be available at the following URL:It is easy to run Cluster Insight locally on your workstation for development purposes:git clone  --branch=v2cd cluster-insight/collectorpip install -r requirements.txtexport KUBERNETES_API=python collector.py --debug --host=localhostRunning the pip and python commands above under  virtualenv  is highly recommended, but not required.Now the Cluster Insight help page will be available at    and if you have kubectl proxy running, the REST API will be operational.
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	REST API	Cluster Insight makes available the following endpoints:
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Context graph format	The context graph is a JSON document with the following format:Resources and relations have a timestamp attribute, indicating when they were first observed or inferred, respectively
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Context graph format	The timestamp value should remain constant as long as the corresponding resource or relation did not change substantially.When comparing resource values, we compute the hash of the JSON representation after removing the attributes timestamp, lastHeartbeatTime and resourceVersion, because their values are ephemeral and do not indicate a substantial change in the corresponding resource
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Context graph format	All data older than one hour is deleted automatically from the cache
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Context graph format	The value of the timestamp attribute will therefore remain constant for at most one hour.The entire context graph has a separate timestamp, which is the maximum of the timestamps of the resources and relations contained in the graph
google-readmegoogle-cluster-insight.md	Context graph format	If the timestamp of the entire context graph did not change, then there wasno substantial change in any of the resources and relations inside it.
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Cluster scheduler simulator overview	This simulator can be used to prototype and compare different cluster scheduling strategies and policies
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Cluster scheduler simulator overview	It generates synthetic cluster workloads from empirical parameter distributions  thus generating unique workloads even from a small amount of input data , simulates their scheduling and execution using a discrete event simulator, and finally permits analysis of scheduling performance metrics.The simulator was originally written as part of research on the "Omega" shared-state cluster scheduling architecture at Google
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Cluster scheduler simulator overview	A paper on Omega, published at EuroSys 2013, uses of this simulator for the comparative evaluation of Omega and other alternative architectures  referred to as a "lightweight" simulator there   1 
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Cluster scheduler simulator overview	As such, the simulators design is somewhat geared towards the comparative evaluation needs of this paper, but it does also permit more general experimentation with:
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Downloading, building, and running	The source code for the simulator is available in a Git repository hosted on Google Code
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Downloading, building, and running	Instructions for downloading  can be found at at The simulator is written in Scala, and requires the Simple Build Tool  sbt  to run
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Downloading, building, and running	A copy of sbt is package with the source code, but you will need the following prerequisites in order to run the simulator:
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Using command line flags	The simulator can be passed some command-line arugments via configuration flags, such as --thread-pool-size NUM_THREADS_INT and --random-seed SEED_VAL_INT
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Using command line flags	To view all options run:Note that when passing command line options to the sbt run command you need to include the word run and all of the options that follow it within a single set of quotes
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Using command line flags	sbt can also be used via the sbt console by simply running bin/sbt which will drop you at a prompt
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Using command line flags	If you are using this sbt console option, you do not need to put quotes around the run command and any flags you pass.
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuration file	If a file conf/cluster-sim-env.sh exists, it will be sourced in the shell before the simulator is run
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuration file	This was added as a way of setting up the JVM  e.g
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuration file	heap size  for simulator runs
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuration file	Check out conf/cluster-sim-env.sh.template as a starting point; you will need to uncomment and possibly modify the example configuration value set in that template file  and, of course, you will need to create a copy of the file removing the ".template" suffix .
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuring experiments	The simulation is controlled by the experiments configured in the src/main/scala/Simulation.scala setup file
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuring experiments	Comments in the file explain how to set up different workloads, workload-to-scheduler mappings and simulated cluster and machine sizes.Most of the workload setup happens in src/main/scala/Workloads.scala, so read through that file and make modifications there to have the simulator read from a trace file of your own  see more below about the type of trace files the simulator uses, and the example files included .Workloads in the simulator are generated from *empirical parameter distributions*
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuring experiments	These are typically based on cluster *snapshotsFor further details, see traces/README.txt and traces/job-distribution-traces/README.txt.**Please note that the resource amounts specified in the example data files, and the example cluster machines configured in Simulation.scala do *notA possible starting point for generating realistic input data is the public Google cluster trace  2, 3 
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuring experiments	It should be straightforward to write scripts that extract the relevant data from the public trace's event logs
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuring experiments	Although we do not provide such scripts, it is worth noting that the "cluster C" workload in the EuroSys paper  1  represents the same workload as the public trace
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Configuring experiments	 If you do write scripts for converting the public trace into simulator format, please let us know, and we will happily include them in the simulator code release! 
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Experimental results: post-processing	Experimental results are stored in serialized Protocol Buffers in the experiment_results directory at the root of the source tree by default: one subdirectory for each experiment, and with a unique name identifying the experimental setup as well as the start time
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Experimental results: post-processing	The schemas for the .protobuf files are stored in src/main/protocolbuffers.A script for post-processing and graphing experimental results is located in src/main/python/graphing-scripts, and src/main/python also contains scripts for converting the protobuf-encoded results into ASCII CSV files
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Experimental results: post-processing	See the README file in the graphing-scripts directory for detailed explanation.
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Changing and compiling the protocol buffers	If you make changes to the protocol buffer file  in src/main/protocolbuffers , you will need to recompile them, which will generate updated Java files in src/main/java
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Changing and compiling the protocol buffers	To do so, you must install the protcol buffer compiler and run src/main/protocolbuffers/compile_protobufs.sh, which itself calls protoc  which it assumes is on your PATH .
google-readmegoogle-cluster-scheduler-simulator.md	Known issues	Please use  the Google Code  project issue tracker  for all bug reports, pull requests and patches, although we are unlikely to be able to respond to feature requests

google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Cmockery Unit Testing Framework	Cmockery is a lightweight library that is used to author C unit tests.There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many ofthem are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Cmockery Unit Testing Framework	 Somedevelopment requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult touse some unit testing frameworks
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Cmockery Unit Testing Framework	 In addition many unit testing frameworksassume the code being tested is an application or module that is targeted tothe same platform that will ultimately execute the test
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Cmockery Unit Testing Framework	 Because of thisassumption many frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headersin the code module being tested which may collide with the custom orincomplete implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.Cmockery only requires a test application is linked with the standard Clibrary which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Cmockery Unit Testing Framework	 Also,Cmockery tries avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.This results in Cmockery being a relatively small library that can be usedto test a variety of exotic code
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Cmockery Unit Testing Framework	 If a developer wishes to simply test anapplication with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks maybe
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Overview	Cmockery tests are compiled into stand-alone executables and linked withthe Cmockery library, the standard C library and module being tested
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Overview	 Anysymbols external to the module being tested should be mocked functions that return values determined by the test application
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Overview	 Even though significant differences may exist between the targetexecution environment of a code module and the environment used to test thecode the unit testing is still valid since its goal is to test the logic of acode modules at a functional level and not necessarily all of its interactionswith the target execution environment.It may not be possible to compile a module into a test application withoutsome modification, therefore the preprocessor symbol *UNIT_TESTINGbe defined when Cmockery unit test applications are compiled so code within themodule can be conditionally compiled for tests.
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Test Execution	Cmockery unit test cases are functions with the signature*void function void &#42;&#42;state *
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Test Execution	 Cmockery test applications initialize atable with test case function pointers using *unit_test&#42;  table is then passed to the *run_tests  *run_tests  other data structures prior to running each test function

google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Failure Conditions	If a failure occurs during a test function that's executed via*run_tests  *, the test function is aborted and the application'sexecution resumes with the next test function.Test failures are ultimately signalled via the Cmockery function *fail  *.The following events will result in the Cmockery library signalling a testRuntime assert macros like the standard C library's *assert  be redefined in modules being tested to use Cmockery's *mock_assert   test failure  #FailureConditions

google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Assert Macros	 On anassertion failure a Cmockery assert macro will write the failure to thestandard error stream and signal a test failure
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Assert Macros	 Due to limitations of theC language the general C standard library assert   and Cmockery'sassert_true   and assert_false   macros can only display the expression thatcaused the assert failure

google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Dynamic Memory Allocation	To test for memory leaks, buffer overflows and underflows a module beingtested by Cmockery should replace calls to *malloc  *, *calloc  *free  *test_free  *test_free  a  test failure  #FailureConditions  is signalled
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Dynamic Memory Allocation	 All blocksallocated using the *test_&#42;  Cmockery library
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Dynamic Memory Allocation	 When a test completes if any allocated blocks  memory leaks remain they are reported and a test failure is signalled.For simplicity Cmockery currently executes all tests in one process.Therefore all test cases in a test application share a single address spacewhich means memory corruption from a single test case could potentially causethe test application to exit prematurely.
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Using Cmockery's Allocators	 allocate_module.c  src/example/allocate_module.c 
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Mock Functions	A unit test should ideally isolate the function or module being testedfrom any external dependencies
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Mock Functions	 This can be performed using mock functionsthat are either statically or dynamically linked with the module being tested.Mock functions must be statically linked when the code being tested directly references external functions
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Mock Functions	 Dynamic linking is simply the process of setting a function pointer in a table used by the tested module to reference a mock function defined in the unit test.
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Return Values	In order to simplify the implementation of mock functions Cmockery providesfunctionality which stores return values for mock functions in each testcase using *will_return  *
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Return Values	 These values are then returned by each mock function using calls to *mock  *.Values passed to *will_return  specified
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Return Values	 Each successive call to *mock  return value from the queue
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Return Values	 This makes it possible for a mock function to usemultiple calls to *mock  return value
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Return Values	 In addition this allows the specification of return values for multiple calls to a mock function.
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Using will_return  	 database.h  src/example/database.h typedef struct DatabaseConnection DatabaseConnection;typedef unsigned int  *QueryDatabase  // Connection to a database.struct DatabaseConnection {// Connect to a database.~~~ customer_database.c  src/example/customer_database.c 
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	#endif // _WIN32	// Connect to the database containing customer information.} unsigned int get_customer_id_by_name ~~~ customer_database_test.c  src/example/customer_database_test.c 
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Checking Parameters	In addition to storing the return values of mock functions, Cmockeryprovides functionality to store expected values for mock function parametersusing the expect_*   functions provided
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Checking Parameters	 A mock function parameter can thenbe validated using the check_expected   macro.Successive calls to expect_*   macros for a parameter queues values tocheck the specified parameter
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Checking Parameters	 check_expected   checks a function parameteragainst the next value queued using expect_*  , if the parameter check fails atest failure is signalled
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Checking Parameters	 In addition if check_expected   is called andno more parameter values are queued a test failure occurs.
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Using expect_*  	 product_database.c  src/example/product_database.c 
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Test State	Cmockery allows the specification of multiple setup and tear down functionsfor each test case
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Test State	 Setup functions, specified by the *unit_test_setup  shared between multiple test cases
google-readmegoogle-cmockery.md	Test State	 In addition, tear down functions,specified by the *unit_test_teardown  *unit_test_setup_teardown  executed for a test case even when it fails.

google-readmegoogle-cocoapods-size.md	CocoaPods Size Measurement	According to  this article  the number one reason users uninstall apps is the size
google-readmegoogle-cocoapods-size.md	CocoaPods Size Measurement	Having a large app can significantly reduce adoption and retention  at the time of writing, apps over 150MB cannot be downloaded over a cellular network 
google-readmegoogle-cocoapods-size.md	CocoaPods Size Measurement	As an SDK developer, it is even more critical to keep your library size in check, as app developers will refuse using your SDK if it adds too much bloat to their app.This repository provides a set of tools which help with the measurement of the final binary size for the given set of CocoaPods.
google-readmegoogle-cocoapods-size.md	Usage examples	Measuring the size of the CocoaPod named AFNetworking using the latest released version:./measure_cocoapod_size.py --cocoapods AFNetworking// Output:Size comes out to be 231568 bytes  measured at version 3.2.1 ./measure_cocoapod_size.py --cocoapods AFNetworking:3.2.0// Output:Size comes out to be 231544 bytes./measure_cocoapod_size.py --cocoapods FirebaseMessaging:3.0.2 FirebaseAnalytics:5.0.0// Output:Size comes to be 1800752 bytes

google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	What's changed?	See the  changelog  CHANGES.md .
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	Why doesn't Prettyprinting of strings work on WordPress?	Apparently wordpress does "smart quoting" which changes close quotes
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	Why doesn't Prettyprinting of strings work on WordPress?	 Thiscauses end quotes to not match up with open quotes.This breaks prettifying as well as copying and pasting of code samples

google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	How do I put line numbers in my code?	You can use the linenums class to turn on line numbering
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	How do I put line numbers in my code?	 If your codedoesn't start at line number 1, you can add a colon and a line number to theend of that class as in linenums:52
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	How do I put line numbers in my code?	For example:You can use the nocode class to identify a span of markup that is not code:
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	I get an error message "a is not a function" or "opt_whenDone is not a function"	If you are calling prettyPrint via an event handler, wrap it in a function.Instead of doing:which will confuse it.
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	How can I customize the colors and styles of my code?	Prettify adds  with classes describing the kind of code
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	How can I customize the colors and styles of my code?	 You cancreate CSS styles to matches these classes.See the  theme gallery  1  for examples.
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	I can't add classes to my code  because it comes from Markdown, etc. 	Instead of  you can use a comment or processinginstructions that survives processing instructions:  worksas explained in  Getting Started  docs/getting_started.md .
google-readmegoogle-code-prettify.md	How can I put line numbers on every line instead of just every fifth line?	Prettify puts lines into an HTML list element so that line numbers aren'tcaught by copy/paste, and the line numbering is controlled by CSS in thedefault stylesheet, prettify.css.The following should turn line numbering back on for the other lines:Please use the official  support group  7  for discussions, suggestions, andgeneral feedback.

google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_2017.md	What is JSON-lite?	For the purpose of this question we are definingJSON-lite to be a stripped down version of JSON
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_2017.md	What is JSON-lite?	In JSON-lite there are onlytwo variable types: STRINGS and OBJECTS.A STRING is a series of characters starting with a " and ending with a ".Inside of a string quotes  "  and backslashes  \  must be escaped with aback-slash  \ 
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_2017.md	What is JSON-lite?	Some characters can be escaped to give them special meaning.They are t and n
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_2017.md	What is JSON-lite?	If you are familiar with programming, you may know thatthere are other escapable characters, but in JSON-lite they are not supported.The following are all valid strings: "" "abc" "\"a\tb\nc\""The following are all invalid strings: """ "\g"An OBJECT is a series of KEY-VALUE pairs starting with a } and separated by commas
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_2017.md	What is JSON-lite?	KEY-VALUE pairs are expressed as a KEY:VALUE wherethe key must be a STRING and the value can be an OBJECT or STRING.The following is a valid key-value pair:  "name":"sam doe"The following is invalid key-value pair:  name:"sam doe"The following are a valid objects:  {  }The following is an invalid object:  {  }The following is a key-value pair where the value is an object:  "name": { "first":"sam", "last":"doe" }It should be noted that between the brances, commas, or colons can be anynumber of whitespace characters.

google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_b_2017.md	Overview	The class has alreadybeen created and students only need to finish implementing its functionality.MyTokenReader is responsible for parsing the text input and converting it toa stream of tokens that the MathLang parser will use to build statements.Statements are then passed to the interpreter to be executed
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_b_2017.md	Overview	Everything exceptfor MyTokenReader has already been implemented.To further understand how com.google.codeu.mathlang.core.tokens.TokenReader
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_b_2017.md	Overview	TokenReader is theinterface that MyTokenReader implements and contains in-code documentationfor how each method should behave.
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_b_2017.md	The Goal	When students have finished their implementation of MyTokenReader
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_b_2017.md	The Goal	Students are encouraged to write their own tests to ensuretheir implementation is working.Students should not use any third-party libraries to complete this assessment.The one exception is the use of a third-party test library to help test theirimplementation of MyTokenReader.When done, an evaluator should be able to run the student's project using thesame build and run instructions provided here
google-readmegoogle-codeu_coding_assessment_b_2017.md	The Goal	This means that if a studentuses a third-party test library, all dependencies must be included with theproject and build.sh and run.sh must be updated.

google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Leaky GHCJS Sandboxing ###	 I recommend that you run CodeWorld as adedicated user account to avoid causing problems for other Haskell installations

google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Authentication	CodeWorld offers two modes of authentication or the ability to run withauthentication disabled with reduced functionality
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Authentication	The two methods providedare as follows:CodeWorld site; this allows CodeWorld to offload account and credentialmanagement to a third partythis is useful for applications where minimal external dependencies is requiredRunning CodeWorld in one of these two modes allows users to save and managetheir projects and folders
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Authentication	With no authentication enabled, users are able towrite, build and run code but lose the ability to save and manage projects and
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	 Google authentication	For Google authentication to work, you will need to obtain a Google API key andstore it in web/clientId.txt.To get a Google API key for your CodeWorld installation, please consult thefollowing resources:CodeWorld instance will immediately pick up changes to this file.In general, the Google authentication system will be the easiest system tomaintain since no local password stores are required
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	 Google authentication	This is the mechanismused by the official, live version of CodeWorld.
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	 Local authentication	For applications in which external dependencies, such as Google accounts, arenot acceptable, we provide a simple local authentication system:Google authentication  i.e
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	 Local authentication	stateless client-side sessions 
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	 Local authentication	Currently, noweb-based administrative interface is provided
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	 Local authentication	Instead, you can use thecodeworld-auth CLI tool to manage accounts.The local authentication system may be useful for situations where aninstructor cannot reasonably expect all students to have a valid Google accountand in which the instructor is willing to deploy a local CodeWorld stack.
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create account database	Local authentication will be enabled if a codeworld-auth.db file is presentin the application's root directory
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create account database	To create this database, run the followingfrom the root of the Git repository:
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create one or more user accounts	Assuming you have already created an account database as described above, youcan create a new account as follows:password
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create one or more user accounts	The account will be set to "Expired" which means the user will beprompted to enter a new password at next sign-in time.Other subcommands are provided for updating and deleting accounts etc
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create one or more user accounts	ForTo use local authentication, you will also need to generate a JWT secret storedin a file named codeworld-auth.txt
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create one or more user accounts	This is used to sign JWT tokens passedback and forth between the server and the browser
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Create one or more user accounts	From the Git repository'sroot directory, run the following command:this secret to external users.
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Swap Space ###	If you are installing CodeWorld on a virtual server, be aware that the defaultRAM on these servers is often not sufficient for GHC
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Swap Space ###	 CodeWorld needs to compile verylarge Haskell projects during its installation
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Swap Space ###	 The following should be sufficient toresolve any out-of-memory problems you encounter:This creates a 2 GB swap file to increase available virtual memory
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Swap Space ###	 Installation witha swap file may be slow, but it will succeed
google-readmegoogle-codeworld.md	Swap Space ###	  Unless you intend to write very largeprograms in CodeWorld, it's usually safe to remove the swap file after running theserver for the first time

google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Entry point	Otherwise fail
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Environment Variables	Runtime should support configuring environment variables via a file
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Networking types	The runtime should support three types of networking
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Host networking	The hosts network adapter is attached directly to the container
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Host networking	No networking namespace
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Private networking	A network namespace just for the container, no external networking
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Virtual/NAT networking	Optionally, the runtime can provide its own networking virtualization layer
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Virtual/NAT networking	This should be exposed to the host as a nic
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Namespace support	Runtime should support full process, filesystem, user, network namespaces
google-readmegoogle-container-rfc.md	Cgroup support	Runtime should support memory limiting, memory with swap limiting, disk IO limits, and CPU thresholds.

google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Copybara	*A tool for transforming and moving code between repositories.*Copybara is a tool used internally at Google
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Copybara	It transforms and moves code between repositories.Often, source code needs to exist in multiple repositories, and Copybara allows you to transformand move source code between these repositories
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Copybara	A common case is a project that involvesmaintaining a confidential repository and a public repository in sync.Copybara requires you to choose one of the repositories to be the authoritative repository, so thatthere is always one source of truth
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Copybara	However, the tool allows contributions to any repository, andany repository can be used to cut a release.The most common use case involves repetitive movement of code from one repository to another.Copybara can also be used for moving code once to a new repository.Examples uses of Copybara include:Currently, the only supported type of repository is Git
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Copybara	Copybara also supports reading from Mercurial repositories, but the feature is still experimental.Support for other repositories types will be added in the future.
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Example	core.workflow  Copybara doesn't have a release process yet, so you need to compile from HEAD
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Example	In order to do thatyou need:If you use Intellij and the Bazel plugin, use this project configuration:directories:  copybara/integration  java/com/google/copybara  javatests/com/google/copybara  third_party  //copybara/integration/..
google-readmegoogle-copybara.md	Example	 //java/com/google/copybara/..

google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Architecture	In this example,see src/templates/index.html for the HTML.A balancer
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Architecture	This is the  Course Builder  installation above
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Architecture	It's a  GoogleApp Engine  application that acts as a proxy and manager for tasks executed on apool of workers.A pool of 1 or more workers, running anywhere but behind one URL
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Architecture	Thesemachines do the actual work of accepting user code, building it into .apks,installing the .apks on an Android VM, running the user code, taking ascreenshot, and relaying results back to the proxy.All wire communication is JSON against REST endpoints
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Architecture	Both the balancer and theworkers expose APIs for the other's use
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Architecture	There are a number of important caveatshere you must read before running this system in production; see the Course Builder Balancer Module  code for details.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	The expected flow for the system as a whole is:User visits a page containing a JS client, with an interface for writing andrunning code.On page load, the client fetches project definition information from thebalancer
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	The balancer dispatches this request to any machine in the workerThe user's page displays UX
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	The user authors code and hits an element totrigger a run action.The user's client dispatches a request to the balancer to create a *task*
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	Atask is a data object that holds bookkeeping information and the state of onerun of user code
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	For example, it contains an identifier for the user, the lastknown state of the task, and the task's *ticket*, which uniquely identifies it.The balancer dispatches a request to create a new task to the worker pool,sending along bookkeeping information about that task  the ticket, what projectit's for, a patch with the code the user wrote, etc
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	.A worker recieves the create task request
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	It forks a background process topatch the user's code onto the project, build .apks, run them, and store theirresult on disk
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	This is nonblocking and the worker immediately returns after theThe balancer returns a response to the user's client with the ticket for thecreated task and the id of the worker allocated to that task  or an error if itcould not create a task for any reason, like all workers being busy .The client receives the ticket and worker id, and polls the balancer forcurrent status.The balancer relays status polls to the correct worker
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	Each poll, the workerreads the current result of the run from disk and sends it to the balancer.The balancer relays current state to the client
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	The client stops pollingwhen the returned state is terminal and updates its UI.Worker implementations are in charge of fitting this flow and maintaining theirhealth  for example, they will need to garbage collect results of old tasks sotheir disks don't fill up 
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Expected flow	See android/worker.py for a sample implementation.See src/resources/client.js for a sample client.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	In addition to the limitations of the  Course Builder Balancer Module  -administrator because different deployments will have different securityrequirements -Worker builds and code execution are both single threaded and lock guarded.This means a single worker may only build/run one task at a time  though it canhandle other requests, like the balancer polling for past task results,concurrently with each other and with the build/run task 
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	Multiple, concurrentrequests for additional build/run tasks will fail instantly with an HTTP 500error indicating the worker is currently locked
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	This could be addressed in anumber of ways  for example, by running multiple Android VMs per worker, each onits own port .We do no defense against malicious user code submissions
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	The most trivialmalicious code submission is simply an infinite loop; this would lock a workerand never unlock it
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	Multiple submissions of code with an infinite loop wouldeventually lock the entire worker pool
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	There are multiple ways to address thisproblem, such as time-boxing the execution of user code,whitelisting/blacklisting allowed functionality, etc.We do not supply machine images for properly secured workers
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-android-container-module.md	Limitations	Securing theworker pool is up to deployment administrators, and care must be taken to keepsystems other than the balancer from being able to issue operations against theworker pool.There are some additional, smaller caveats; see android/worker.py for details.Broadly speaking, the intent of this project is to demonstrate feasibility forthe design as a whole, not to serve as a performant, secure production system.For any real deployment, administrators will need to take additional steps toensure performance and security.

google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	coursebuilder-hello-world-module	This is an example  Course Builder  module that shows you how to create, run,and test extensions to the system
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	coursebuilder-hello-world-module	It is not an official Google product.We strongly recommend making customizations by creating a module, avoidingchanges to the core Course Builder codebase where possible
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	coursebuilder-hello-world-module	This not only makesyou less likely to accidentally break something with your changes, but you'llalso find it much easier to upgrade to new versions of Course Builder as they're
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Requirements	You'll need a system with current versions of python 2.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Getting started	First, clone Course Builder and change directory to the Course Builder root:start by grabbing Course Builder, then using it to fetch the module you want towork with
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Getting started	Let's grab this module, called hello, next:start up Course Builder with this module installed:
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Module contents	The structure of this module is
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	module.yaml	This file defines your module
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	module.yaml	This is best explained by example
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	module.yaml	Here's themodule.yaml for this module, annotated:When you run coursebuilder/tests/ext/, respectively 
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	module.yaml	These locations mustmatch the dotted patterns found in your module.yaml or you will have problemsimporting your module at runtime.In most cases you will not need to modify this file, and can just copy itdirectly into a new module
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	module.yaml	If you are creating a new module and cannot usemodules.sh because your files are not yet found in a version control system,you can run this script directly to install your module into your local CourseBuilder directory
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	module.yaml	Run it with sh scripts/setup.sh -h for details.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	src	Your module's source files
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	src	You may put whatever you want here; this samplemodule has some templates and a single Python file that declares our handlers.View that file for details on creating handlers, both with and without userauthentication, and with and without awareness of a current course
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	src	Whencreating a new module, remember to put an __init__.py file in this directoryor you will have import problems.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	tests	Your module's test files
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	tests	You may put whatever you want here; this simplemodule provides an example of functional tests using  Webtest 
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	tests	When creating anew module, remember to put an __init__.py file in this directory or you willhave import problems.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Working with this module	After you've downloaded and installed this module, start Course Builder normallyto use it: this is what Course Builder does for you if you clicked **Create Empty Course*also assume you're starting your local server on the default hostname and port.View the global handler at 
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Working with this module	Sign in and out tosee how the UI changes.Now, view the handler that's aware of the current course at
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Working with this module	Notice how it can display the name of thecourse
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Working with this module	Signing in and out works as before, but note you will not be able toview the handler when signed out unless you've edited the course to make itpublic
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Working with this module	This is normal: Course Builder does not display newly-created courses tothe public by default so you can hold off on showing your content to peoplebefore it's done.
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Running tests	You can run specific tests with test.sh, which is in coursebuilder/scripts.For example, after you've installed this module, you can run all its tests fromthe Course Builder root with:Sometimes you don't want to fetch a module from a remote repository, but insteadwant to use source from local disk
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Running tests	This happens often when creating a newmodule
google-readmegoogle-coursebuilder-hello-world-module.md	Running tests	The module system allows you to address this by passing a localfilesystem path into the modules script.The set of allowable paths is limited to those under /tmp, /var/folders, andone level up from where you are invoking the modules script.We suggest creating a symlink from your local file location to /$HOME/src/coursebuilder-hello-world-module, you would first create thesymlink with

google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	cpu_features     ! Build status  	A cross-platform C library to retrieve CPU features  such as availableinstructions  at runtime.
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Checking features at runtime	Here's a simple example that executes a codepath if the CPU supports both theAES and the SSE4.2 instruction sets:
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	#include "cpuinfo_x86.h"	static const X86Info info = GetX86Info  ;static const X86Microarchitecture uarch = GetX86Microarchitecture &info ;static const bool has_fast_avx = info.features.avx && uarch != INTEL_SNB;// use has_fast_avx.This feature is currently available only for x86 microarchitectures.
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Caching for faster evaluation of complex checks	If you wish, you can read all the features at once into a global variable, andthen query for the specific features you care about
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Caching for faster evaluation of complex checks	Below, we store all the ARMfeatures and then check whether AES and NEON are supported.
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	#include "cpuinfo_arm.h"	static const ArmFeatures features = GetArmInfo  .features;static const bool has_aes_and_neon = features.aes && features.neon;// use has_aes_and_neon.This is a good approach to take if you're checking for combinations of featureswhen using a compiler that is slow to extract individual bits from bit-packed
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Checking compile time flags	The following code determines whether the compiler was told to use the AVXinstruction set  e.g., g++ -mavx  and sets has_avx accordingly.
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Rejecting poor hardware implementations based on microarchitecture	On x86, the first incarnation of a feature in a microarchitecture might not bethe most efficient  e.g
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Rejecting poor hardware implementations based on microarchitecture	AVX on Sandy Bridge 
google-readmegoogle-cpu_features.md	Rejecting poor hardware implementations based on microarchitecture	We provide a function to retrievethe underlying microarchitecture so you can decide whether to use it.Below, has_fast_avx is set to 1 if the CPU supports the AVX instructionset&mdash;but only if it's not Sandy Bridge.

google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	OpenGL is a thread-bound API
google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	That is, an OpenGL context must be bound  or "madecurrent"  on a thread before any other OpenGL functions may be called.The Dart VM uses a pool of native threads under the hood to carry out tasks onthe event queue  overview of the Dart event loop This leads to an unfortunate restriction on the use of asynchronous code whilemaking OpenGL calls from Dart
google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	This is bad:glfwMakeContextCurrent context ;glClear GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ;// other OpenGL calls ...// Wait for an async task to finish.await someFuture;// Draw a triangle.glDrawArrays GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3 ;// etc...The issue is that the context is made current, then there is a call to await,which causes the current task to return to the event loop until someFuturecompletes
google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	When control returns to the next line, it may be running on acompletely different native thread, where the context is not bound.To avoid this issue, the code must be changed to something resembling theglfwMakeContextCurrent context ;glClear GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ;// other OpenGL calls ...// Release the context before waiting.glfwMakeContextCurrent NULL ;// Wait for an async task to finish.await someFuture;// We're back!  Reacquire the context.glfwMakeContextCurrent context ;// Draw a triangle.glDrawArrays GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3 ;// etc...This way, the context is released from the thread before control returns to theevent loop and then reacquired when it comes back.Note that this applies to any asynchronous code  not just an await 
google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	Here'sanother bad example:glfwMakeContextCurrent context ;glClear GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ;// other OpenGL calls ...// Load an image, then create a texture.var f = new File "image.rgb" ;f.readFileAsBytes  .then  bytes  {  var tex = glGenTextures 1 ;  glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex ;  glTexImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA, width, height, 0, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,} ;// etc...In this case, there's no guarantee that the callback to the readFileAsBytes would be running on the same thread as the original task.In practice, most OpenGL code is written synchronously, as it's generally notadvisable to be waiting for other tasks to complete while in the middle ofrendering a frame
google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	However, it's important to be aware of this restriction
google-readmegoogle-dart-gl.md	A note about OpenGL, the Dart VM, and native threads	Whenmaking OpenGL calls, either avoid awaiting asynchronous methods and makingOpenGL calls in async callbacks, or properly release the context anytime controlreturns to the event loop, and reacquire it when ready to make OpenGL calls

google-readmegoogle-dart-immutables.md	Immutables   	An experiment on wrapping arbitrary values to make them *recursively_Disclaimer_: This is not an official Google product.Immutable wrappers proxy every getter & non-mutating method call to theirwrapped value, and the return values from these calls are recursively wrapped.Users can bind wrappers that implement the interface of their wrapped class to play nice with checked mode 
google-readmegoogle-dart-immutables.md	Immutables   	Support for explicitly whitelisting methodsas being non-mutating is being considered.
google-readmegoogle-dart-immutables.md	What is immutable?	This library assumes a couple of invocations are not mutating their targets:allows getters to cache their results and still be considered non-mutating.be non-mutating, but this might not be true for LRU caches, etc.
google-readmegoogle-dart-immutables.md	Note on mirror usage	This library does not require any symbol to be preserved, but does need someway to call getters / methods by symbol  not by name 
google-readmegoogle-dart-immutables.md	Note on mirror usage	This is currently donewith the  smoke  library, but since Ihaven't written the required transformer yet the whole immutable library is justdisabled when compiling with dart2js.
google-readmegoogle-dart-immutables.md	Usage	For instance, if you have a class Foo that you want to expose as immutable:

google-readmegoogle-dart-scissors.md	Installing CSSJanus	You'll need a local install of  CSSJanus  for CSS mirroring.Note that this transformer uses Google's original cssjanus.py, not its .js port   github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus  which might work if packaged as a binary that consumes css from stdin and outputs mirrored css on stdout .To install CSSJanus, run the following command in a console  ensure you have something like export PATH=~/bin:$PATH in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc :  mkdir ~/bin  curl  > ~/bin/cssjanus.py  chmod +x ~/bin/cssjanus.py  
google-readmegoogle-dart-scissors.md	Other deps: SassC, pngcrush...	These packages are quite standard, you can get them with brew install on MacOS X and with sudo apt-get install on Ubuntu:The default transformer will build Sass files in a blink of aneye and will optimize CSS, PNG and SVG assets in release mode pub build .Please only setup sCiSSors's transformer on projects you know respect sCiSSors'conventions and limitations  see below .Examples: see  example/angular1   example/angular2   dev_dependencies:  transformers:Valid settings:  using Angular2 with ViewEncapsulation.None  see section below .Angular 1,2  provide the following  strategies   in Angular2  in Angular2The first two strategies  Shadow DOM & its transcluded emulation  provide strictencapsulation of style at the component level: styles defined in a componentdo not leak to any of its sub-components or parent components
google-readmegoogle-dart-scissors.md	Other deps: SassC, pngcrush...	This is theassumption by which sCiSSors lives, so you're safe with it.The last "unscoped" strategy means there's no filecomponent-local way of deciding if a style *couldnot use sCiSSors on packages / projects with that strategy.
google-readmegoogle-dart-scissors.md	Using scissors/css_mirroring_transformer	See  BidirectionalCss  BidirectionalCss.md  for more details.Example: see  example/mirroring   dev_dependencies:  transformers:Valid settings:Example: see  example/permutations   dev_dependencies:  transformers:Valid settings:  provoking 404s in production when sourcemaps aren't served  relevant only  when the $dart2js transformer has setting sourceMaps: true .This provides an amazing development turnaround experience, whether you're usingthe other sCiSSors transformers or not.With pub serve --force-poll, as soon as you save an asset  say, foo.scss and it finished building the dependent assets  say, foo.scss.css , the appwill reload
google-readmegoogle-dart-scissors.md	Using scissors/css_mirroring_transformer	That's typically before you even have the time to tab-switch tothe browser  + no need to Ctrl+R .The transformer ensures the automatic reload logic is removed in releasebuilds  pub build , without interfering with source maps.Example: see  example/permutations Just edit pubspec.yaml  note: it's in dev_dependencies, not dependencies :  dev_dependencies:  transformers:And edit main.dart:  import 'package:scissors/reloader/reloader.dart';  }  Valid settings:See  UnawaitedFutures  UnawaitedFutures.md  for more details.Keep in mind that this transformer is very experimental, and slow.It aims to complement Dart's new strong-mode analyzer with more static checks,some of which could eventually graduate to the analyzer itself

google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	This library provides the ability to process messages passed onto a dataLayer queue.A dataLayer queue is simply a JavaScript array that lives on a webpage.its state.be metadata about the page content, information about the visitor, or data about events happening on the page
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	This system allows tools like analytics libraries and tag management systems to access this data in a standard way, so page authors can avoid using a bunch of proprietary, repetitive APIs.The dataLayer system make things very easy for page authors
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	The syntax is simple, and there's noextra code to load
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	But this system _does_ make life a little more difficult for vendors and toolsthat want to consume the data
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	That's where this library comes in
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	This project provides the ability to listen for dataLayer messages and to read the key/value pairs that have been set by all the previous messages
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	It can be used by the tools/vendors mentioned above, or by page authors that need to read back the data they've emitted.To use this library, you'll need to get it onto the page
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	You can do this by hosting a copy and sourcing it from the page, or by compiling it into your own JavaScript library
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	Once it's on the page, you can create a new helper object like this:merged into the helper's **"abstract data model"**
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	 This internal model object holds the most recentvalue for all keys which have been set on messages processed by the helper
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Data Layer Helper Library	You can retrieve values from the data model by using the helper's get   method:author might push the following message, which has data multiple levels deep:
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	As mentioned above, the abstract data model is an internal representation, which holdsthe most recent value for all keys that have been set by a dataLayer message
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	This means that as each message is pushed onto the dataLayer, the abstract data model must be updated
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	The helper library does this using a well-defined process
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	As each message is processed, its key/value pairs will be added to the abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	If the key doesn't currently exist in the model, this operation is simple
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	The pair is simply added to the model object
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	But in the case of key conflicts, we haveto specify how values will be overwritten and/or merged.There are two possible actions to take when merging a key/value pair onto the abstract model; overwriting the existing value or recursively merging the new value onto the existing value
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	The action taken will depend on the type of the two values
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	For this, we define three types of values:objects that were created via Object literal notation  e.g
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	{one: 2}  or via "new Object".Nulls, Dates, RegExps, Windows, DOM Elements, etc
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	are not "Plain"
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	The Abstract Data Model	Those fall into the category of "everything else", along with strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, etc.following table to describe what action will happen for that key/value pair:Existing Value | New ValueArrayPlain Object   | ArrayPlain Object   | Plain Object | Recursively mergePlain Object   | OtherOther
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Overwriting Existing Values	When the merging action is "Overwrite exsting value", the result of the operation is verysimple
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Overwriting Existing Values	The existing value will be completely discarded and the new value will take its place in the abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Overwriting Existing Values	The following table provides some examples:Existing Value   | New Value{ducks: 'quack'} |  1, 2, 3 {ducks: 'quack'} | 'hello''hello'
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Recursively Merging Values	When the merging action is "Recursively Merge", the result of the operation will be the result of iterating through each property in the new value, and for each property, deciding how to copy that sub-key/value into the abstract data model by looking at the type of that sub-key in the existing value
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Recursively Merging Values	If the key does not exist on the existing value, the new value is simply assigned to the abstract model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Recursively Merging Values	The following examples demonstrate this:Existing Value{one: 1, three: 3} | {three: 4}{one: {two: 3}}{one: {two: 3}}   1  1, {two: 3} 
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	Using the above methods alone, some operations on the abstract model are somewhat cumbersome.For example, appending items onto the end of an existing array requires you to know the length of the existing array and then requires you to clumsily build an array that can be merged onto the existing value
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	 To make these cases easier, we provide a set of alternative syntaxes for updating values that are already in the abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	The first of these syntaxes allows you to call any method supported on the existing type
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	For example, if the existing value in the abstract model is an Array, you'd have a wide variety of APIs that can be called  e.g
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	push, pop, concat, shift, unshift, etc
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	 To invokethis syntax, you would push a "command array" onto the dataLayer instead of a normal message contains the key of the value to update, followed by a dot  
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	, followed by the name of the method to invoke on the value
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	 In the above example, the key to update is 'abc', and the method to invoke is the 'push' method
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Meta Commands	 The string may be followed by zero or more arguments, which will be passed to the invoked method.exception, the assignment will be ignored, and a warning message will be logged to the browser's developer console  if available .
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Native Methods	Browsers come with dozens, if not hundreds, of useful APIs
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Native Methods	Any method supported by the existing value can be called using the command array syntax
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Native Methods	Here are some additional examples:                In the following example, no arguments are provided:                In the following example, the value to update  bbb  is nested inside a top level object  aaa :                And the following example demonstrates an operation on a Date object
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Native Methods	 Remember that all types are supported, not just Arrays:                Notice that because command arrays are processed asynchronously, nothing can be done with the return values from these method invocations
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Native Methods	This brings us to our second syntax for updating values in the abstract data model.
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	So far, we've seen that objects  messages  can be pushed onto the dataLayer, as well as arrays  command arrays 
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	Pushing a function onto the dataLayer will also allow you to update the abstract data model, but with custom code
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	This technique has the added benefit of being able to handle return values of any native method calls made from within the function.When a function is processed, it will be executed in the context of the abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	The value of "this" will be an interface that represents the current abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	This interfact will provide two APIs: get key  and set key, value 
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	The following examples demonstrate how these APIs can be used to update values in the abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Custom Methods	           this.get 'time' .setMonth 0 ; }       The following example demonstrates updating a nested value:            var ccc = this.get 'aaa.bbb.ccc' ;  ccc.push ccc.pop   }       The following example demonstrates overwriting a value:            this.set 'abc', {xyz: this.get 'abc' } ;}       
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Listening for Messages	When creating a DataLayerHelper object, you can also specify a callback function to be called whenever a message is pushed onto the given dataLayer
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Listening for Messages	This allows your code to be notifiedimmediately whenever the dataLayer has been updated, which is a key advantage of the messagequeue approach.Tools that are loaded onto the page asynchronously or lazily will appreciate that you can alsoopt to process message that were pushed onto the dataLayer in the past
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Listening for Messages	This can be done by passing true as the third parameter in the DataLayerHelper constructor.has ever been pushed onto the given dataLayer
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Listening for Messages	And on each call to the callback, the modelwill represent the abstract model at the time of the message.
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Summary	We've seen above that the dataLayer provides a simple API for page authors
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Summary	They simply definean array called dataLayer, then push messages onto it
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Summary	There are three types of messages:listens for new messages and merges them onto its abstract data model
google-readmegoogle-data-layer-helper.md	Summary	You can query the modelusing the get   API, or you can get message notifications with a callback function.At this point, we highly recommend that you read the code and browse the tests for examples ofhow the library works and how it can be used.

google-readmegoogle-dev-on-chromeos-openvpn.md	Motivation	When trying to develop on a Chromebook, I didn't like three things:I find it frustratingly slow to use a full remote desktop solution.Tools exist for remote development  such as Eclipse Che  but they work best on a privateIt it very difficult to do the equivalent of setting a host file on a ChromeOS system.So I decided that the best way to accomplish this was to create an Docker image for OpenVPN that Icould run on any server I had access to  a cloud VPN, a headless machine in a bookshelf, etc , thatprovided its own DNS service.

google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	The DeviceHub is based on a client/server architecture
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	In the middle of theDeviceHub test framework is the DevieHub server which facilitates the communications among devices
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	The tests use device clients to communicate with theDeviceHub server and send requests to other devices to perform certain actions.For Android devices, you can add custom code to provide test specific functions by extendingCustomCodeHandler provided in the device directory, these functions can be called aspart of the test logic
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	For example, imagine a test scenario where two devices are involved: abroadcaster and a receiver
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	The test is to verify that the message broadcasted by the former isreceived on the latter correctly
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	Here are the test steps: The test asks the receiver to start accept new messages
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	The test asks the broadcaster to broadcast a message
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	The test asks the receiver if it has received the expected message
google-readmegoogle-devicehub.md	DeviceHub	In this scenario, you can provide two custom code to receive message and to send message

google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 DICOM really isn't that hard to parse so I figured I would just make my own
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Here are some of the key things that Ireally wanted out of a DICOM library that I am hoping to deliver:_License is extremely liberal so it could be used in any type of project_DICOM is an open standard and parsing it is easy enough that it should be freely available forall types of products will help it see the widest possible adoption  which will in the end help the most patients .I will dual license it under GPL if someone asks._Only deals with parsing DICOM I am a big believer in small reusable pieces of software and loose coupling
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 There is no reason totightly couple the parser with image display
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I hope that keeping this library small and simple willhelp it reach the widest adoption._Designed to work well in a browser  modern ones at least _There are some  good javascript DICOM parsing libraries  available for server development on node.js but theywon't automatically work in a browser
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I needed a library that let me easily parse WADO responses andI figured others would also prefer a simple library to do this with no dependencies.The library does make use of the  ArrayBuffer object which is widely supported except for IE  it is available on IE10+ 
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I have no current plans to add supportfor older versions of IE but would be open to contributions if someone wants to do the work._Follows modern javascript best practices_This of course means different things to different people but I have found great benefit from making suremy javascript passes  jshint  and leveraging the module pattern   I also have a great affinity to AMD modules  but I understand that not everyone wants to use them.So for this library I am shooting for simply making sure the code uses the module pattern and passes jshint._Has documentation and examples on how to use it_Do I really need to convince you that this is needed?_Does not hide the underlying data stream from you_I have used many DICOM parsing libraries over the years and most of them either hide the underlying byte streamfrom you or make it difficult to access
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 There are times when you need to access the underlying bytes  it is frustrating when the library works against you
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 A few examples of the need for this includeUN VR's, private attributes, encapsulated pixel data and implicit little endian transfersyntaxes  which unfortunately are still widely being used  when you don't have a complete data dictionary.This library addresses this issue by exposing the offset and length of the data portion of each element
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 It also defers parsing  and type converting  the data until it is actually asked to do so
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	So what you get from a parse is basically a set of pointers to where the data for each element is in thebyte stream and then you call the function you want to extract the type you want
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 An awesome sideeffect of this is that you don't need a data dictionary to parse a file even if it uses implicitlittle endian
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 It also turns out that parsing this way is very fast as it avoids doing unneeded type conversions.Note that you cannot 100% reliably parse sequence elements in an implicit little endiantransfer syntax without a data dictionary
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I therefore *stronglysyntaxes whenever possible
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Fortunately most Image Archives should be able to give you an explicittransfer syntax encoding of your sop instance even if it received it in implicit little endian.Note that WADO's default transfer syntax is explicit little endian so one would assume that anImage Archive supporting WADO would have a good data dictionary management system.Initially I wasn't going to support parsing of implicit data at all but decided to mainly forconvenience  and the fact that many of my test data sets are in little endian transfer syntax and I am toolazy to convert them to explicit transfer syntax ._Does not require a data dictionary_As a client, you usually you know which elements you want to access and know what type they are so designing aclient oriented parser around a data dictionary is adding unnecessary complexity, especially if you can stick toexplicit transfer syntaxes
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I also believe it is the the server's responsibility to provide the client safe and easily digestable data  i.e
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	explicit transfer syntaxes 
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 A server typically supportsmany types of clients so it makes sense to centralize data dictionary management in one place ratherthan burden each client with it.Data dictionaries are not required for most client use cases anyway so I decided not to support it in this libraryat all
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 For those use cases that do require a data dictionary, you can layer it on top of this library
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 An exampleof doing so is provided in the live examples
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 If you do want to know the VR, request the instance in anexplicit transfer syntax and you can have it
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 If your Image Archive can't do this for you, get a new one _Decodes individual elements "on demand" See above, this is related to not requiring a data dictionary
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Usually you know exactly what elements you needand what their types are
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 The only time this is not the case is when you are building a DICOM Dump utility oryou can't get an explicit transfer syntax and have one of those problematic elements that can be either OB or OW  and youcan _usually_ figure out which one it is without the VR anyway _Code guards against corrupt or invalid data streams by sanity checking lengths and offsets_Even though you would expect an Image Archive to _never_ send you data that isn't 100% DICOM compliant,that is not a bet I would make
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 As I like to say who ship software that creates bytes streams that violate the DICOM standard
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Regardless, it is goodpractice to never trust data from another system _Does not depend on any external dependencies Sort of addressed above as maximizing adoption requires that the library minimize the burden on its users
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I didfind a few interesting libraries that were targeted at making it easier and safer to parse byte streams butthey just seemed like overkill so I decided to do it all in one to keep it as simple as it could be
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 In generalI am a big fan of building complex systems from lots of smaller simpler pieces
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Some goodreferences on this include the  microjs site  and the cujo.js manifseto _Has unit tests_I generally feel that units tests are _often_ a waste of time for front end development
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Where unit tests do make senseis code that is decoupled from the user interface  TDD  on this project and had unit testscovering ~ 80% of the code paths passing before I even tried to load my first real DICOM file
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 Before I wrotethis library, I did a quick prototype without unit tests that actually took me much less time writing tests takes time...
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	  So in the end I don't think it saved me much time getting to a first release,but I am hoping it will pay for itself in the long run  especially if this library receives wide adoption .I also know that some people out there won't even look at it unless it has good test coverage.Interesting note here the standard difficult to understand in these areas and didn't want to waste my time building tests that were notcorrect
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 I ended up making these work by throwing a variety of data sets at it and fixing the issues that I found.Getting this working took about 3x longer than everything else combined so perhaps it would have been faster if I hadused TDD on this part._Code is easy to understand_In my experience, writing code that is easy to understand is *far more importanttests for that code
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 The reason is that when a developer needs to fix or enhance a piece of code, they _almost never_start with the unit tests or documentation If some other developer is looking at your code, you probably made a mistake really blew it
google-readmegoogle-dicomParser.md	inflater	 In either case, you should have mercy on them in advance and make their unenviable task of fixingor extending your code the best it can be

google-readmegoogle-dimsum.md	Background	Dimsum is a portable C++  SIMD  library,that is heavily influenced by the C++ standard library proposal P0214 Currently, the library does not implement P0214, but its ultimate state is astandard conforming implementation.During the implementation, we examined all the differences our our intendedinterfaces and P0214, and provided a feedback proposal P0820 Due to prioritization, Dimsum does not currently implement the following listof features from P0214, including but not limited to:in the namespace "dimsum" and namespace "dimsum::x86"
google-readmegoogle-dimsum.md	Background	The extra operations in"dimsum" include many "horizontal" operations like shuffle, zip, and reduce-add;the extra operations in "x86" provides some x86-specific semantics, with nativeimplementations on x86 and emulations on other architectures.
google-readmegoogle-dimsum.md	Documentation	Refer to standard proposals for designs and public interfaces.For the implementation, all the public interfaces should be documented in comments.

google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Overview	However, depending on what type of new TLD you want to test, you can substitute any of the strings in the  Domain Test TLDs  #domain-test-tlds  section of this documentation.
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	HTTP Testing API	You can use the HTTP Testing API to construct an HTTP GET or POST request that results in a predictable server response
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	HTTP Testing API	By observing your application's handling of the server’s response, you can determine whether the application making the HTTP call works properly with new TLDs
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	HTTP Testing API	GET requests should use the following syntax:POST requests can mix parameters between the query string, like GET, and the POST body
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	HTTP Testing API	Both multipart/form-data and application/x-www-form-urlencoded are supported, and the postpayload parameter does not interpret the POST body at all.The HTTP Testing API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing on all requests, including support for preflight
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	HTTP Testing API	This means that you can test AJAX requests to new TLDs from JavaScript running on any page.
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	ECHO	The echo command instructs the Domain Test service to echo a response based on the parameters you specify
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	ECHO	You can construct an ECHO command with one or more of the parameters below.The request below will return a 302 redirect to .The request below will return a 302 redirect to  after sleeping for 10 seconds.
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	STASH	The stash command instructs the Domain Test service to stash a response to the parameters specified in the request for later retrieval
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	STASH	It uses the same parameters as the echo command
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	STASH	A stashed payload is truncated after 10K.For example, the request below will stash the string 'stashed-narwhal'.The Domain Test service responds to stash requests with a temp URL in the form below, which can be used later to retrieve the stashed response.A single temp URL is available for use for 5 minutes after it's been generated, and it can be used once
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	STASH	Note that stashed data is stored in memory and should be considered highly ephemeral
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	STASH	Under some circumstances it may be lost even before the stated expiration time, in which case you should re-stash and try again.
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	TOKEN	Alternatively, you can use the URL below if you want to pre-generate a token *beforeIf you’ve pre-generated a token prior to stashing a request, you can assign a stash command to your pre-generated token using the token parameter:A single pre-generated token can be used an unlimited number of times within one hour of generation.
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Security Considerations	By design, the Domain Test service is highly insecure
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Security Considerations	You should consider any data sent to the service to be public and should not stash or email anything other than test data
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Security Considerations	It is trivial to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the domaintest.みんな origin, both directly via /echo and stored via /stash, so it is crucial that there not be anything private within the same domain that is worth stealing
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Security Considerations	For this reason, there is no content on the domains listed below other than the Domain Test service.You should think carefully before running the service on your own domain, since it opens an XSS vector against any other content on the domain
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Security Considerations	In addition, since stored XSS attacks can live beyond the lifetime of a stash  for example, by manipulating the HTML5 Application Cache , running the service on a domain name means that the domain name in question will *always
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Client Software	Suppose you’ve developed an RSS reader and want to know whether it’ll work with feeds that are served off of a new TLD
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Client Software	You can use the HTTP Testing API to craft a URL that returns an RSS feed
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Client Software	Here's an example using GET: In practice, it may be easier to prepare a smaller URL by using /stash with the postpayload parameter
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Client Software	You can take this URL and plug it into your app
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Client Software	If your app works properly --
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Webhooks	You can use the /stash endpoint to test webhooks
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Webhooks	Suppose you are testing a service that posts the weather to a URL of your choosing every few minutes
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Webhooks	You can go to the /token endpoint on domaintest.みんな and get a token that you can use with /stash
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Webhooks	Then you give the weather service a URL that looks like this:This will cause the Domain Test server to save whatever gets POSTed to this URL and make it available here:You can then poll this URL until there is something there to see
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Webhooks	If the service successfully posted the weather to this new TLD's "webhook" then you will be able to see it
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Testing Webhooks	If nothing shows up, even after the weather should have been sent, you've probably found a bug!
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Other Things to Try	By combining the various parameters of /stash and /echo, you can make the Domain Test service mimic almost any kind of server
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Other Things to Try	Here are some things to try:
google-readmegoogle-domaintest.md	Installation Instructions	If you are the registry operator of one or more TLDs, and you wish to configure an instance of domaintest for your TLD s , follow these instructions:Delegate the domain domaintest.yourtld to yourself for every applicable TLD.Set the domains' nameservers to ns1.google.com, ns2.google.com, ns3.google.com, and ns4.google.com.Send an email to crr-tech@google.com with a subject line of "New Domaintest domains" and include a list of all domaintest domains that you just created.Wait up to a few weeks for the new sites to go live.

google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Usage	To generate a single .html sample run:python generator.py To generate multiple samples with a single call run:python generator.py --output_dir  --no_of_files The generated samples will be placed in the specified directory and will be named as fuzz-&lt;number&gt;.html, e.g
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Usage	fuzz-1.html, fuzz-2.html etc
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Usage	Generating multiple samples is faster because the input grammar files need to be loaded and parsed only once.
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Code organization	generator.py contains the main script
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Code organization	It uses grammar.py as a library and contains additional helper code for DOM fuzzing.grammar.py contains the generation engine that is mostly application-agnostic and can thus be used in other  i.e
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Code organization	non-DOM  generation-based fuzzers
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Code organization	As it can be used as a library, its usage is described in a separate section below..txt files contain grammar definitions
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Code organization	There are 3 main files, html.txt, css.txt and js.txt which contain HTML, CSS and JavaScript grammars, respectively
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Code organization	These root grammar files may include content from other files.
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Using the generation engine and writing grammars	To use the generation engine with a custom grammar, you can use the following python code:from grammar import Grammarmy_grammar = Grammar  my_grammar.parse_from_file 'input_file.txt' result_string = my_grammar.generate_symbol 'symbol_name' The following sections describe the syntax of the grammar files.
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	Domato is based on an engine that, given a context-free grammar in a simple format specified below, generates samples from that grammar.A grammar is described as a set of rules in the following basic format: = a mix of constants and sEach grammar rule contains a left side and the right side separated by the equal character
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	The left side contains a symbol, while the right side contains the details on how that symbol may be expanded
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	When expanding a symbol, all symbols on the right-hand side are expanded recursively while everything that is not a symbol is simply copied to the output
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	Note that a single rule can't span over multiple lines of the input file.Consider the following simplified example of a part of the CSS grammar:a { width:100% }b { width:100% }Note there are two rules for the 'selector' symbol
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	In such cases, when the generator is asked to generate a 'selector', it will select the rule to use at random
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	It is also possible to specify the probability of the rule using the 'p' attribute, for example:There are other attributes that can be applied to symbols in addition to the probability
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Basic syntax	Those are listed in a separate section.Consider another example for generating html samples:
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	To generate programming language code, a similar syntax can be used, but there are a couple of differences
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	Each line of the programming language grammar is going to correspond to the line of the output
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	Because of that, the grammar syntax is going to be more free-form to allow expressing constructs in various programming languages
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	Secondly, when a line is generated, in addition to outputting the line, one or more variables may be created and those variables may be reused when generating other lines
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	Again, let's take a look of the simplified example:!varformat fuzzvar%05d!lineguard try {  } catch e  {}!begin lines = document.getElementById "" ;.doSomething  ;!end linesIf we instruct the engine to generate 5 lines, we may end up with something like:Everything after the first '#' character on the line is considered a comment, so for example:The grammar syntax has a way of telling the fuzzer which rules are nonrecursive and can be safe to use even if the maximum level of recursion has been reached
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	This is done with the ‘nonrecursive’ attributes
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Generating programming language code	An example is given below.
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including and importing other grammar files	In Domato, including and importing grammars are two different context.Including is simpler
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including and importing other grammar files	You can use:Importing works a bit differently:
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	Sometimes you might want to call custom Python code in your grammar
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	For example, let’s say you want to use the engine to generate a http response and you want the body length to match the 'Size' header
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	Since this is something not possible with normal grammar rules, you can include custom Python code to accomplish it like this:!begin function savesize  context 'size'  = ret_val!end function!begin function createbody  n = int context 'size'    ret_val = 'a' !end function =  = Size:  = The python functions are defined between ‘!begin function ’ and ‘!end function’ commands
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	The functions can be called in two ways: using ‘beforeoutput’ attribute and using  symbol.By specifying the ‘beforeoutput’ attribute in some symbol, the corresponding function will be called when this symbol is expanded, just before the result of the expansion is output to the sample
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	The expansion result will be passed to the function in the ret_val variable
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	The function is then free to modify ret_val, store it for later use or perform any other operations.When using a special  symbol, the function  specified in a ‘function’ attribute  will be called when the symbol is encountered during language generation
google-readmegoogle-domato.md	Including Python code	Any value stored by the function in ret_val will be considered the result of the expansion  ret_val gets included in the sample .Your python code has access to the following variables:The following symbols have a special meaning and should not be redefined by users:The following attributes are supported:Some of the bugs that have been found with Domato:This is not an official Google product.

google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Overview	Take a look at the examples below to see how your code can be transformed.
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Examples	Below are some simple examples for using dPy
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Examples	For a complete usage example set that alse runs, check out example.py.
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Simple	Any argument can be turned into an injected argument.from dpy import IN, Inject, Injectabledef Go where=IN :  # Go is fully injected!  print 'Hello ' + whereInjectable.value where='World' Go    # Invokes the function 
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Mixing	You don't have to inject all of your arguments!from dpy import IN, Inject, Injectabledef Go when, how='train', where=IN :  # Partial injection  print 'We need the %s %s, %s!' %  where, how, when Injectable.value where='California' Go 'now', how='car'   # Invokes the function 
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Scoping	Scopes are useful when creating servers or threaded designs that revisit the same code with different data.You'll probably want to swap out injections, scoping them to a particular stack or thread.As you would hope, they use the current scope when they are requested  not the one in which they were defined .If not using scopes, it's an error to set the same injectable key more than once!from dpy import IN, Inject, Injectable, Scopedef Go where=IN :  print 'Hello ' + wheredef HandleRequest request :  Injectable.value where=request.destination   Go    # Invokes the function Singletons have the behavior you would expect; they are single to their scope branch.
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Injection Types	There are different ways to specify injectables.from dpy import Injectable, SingletonInjectable.value foo=object   
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	def bar  :  """2  Provides an injectable bar
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	 In effect, no two injections of bar will ever be  i.e
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	is  the same object
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	 """  return object  @Singletondef cat  :  """3  Provides a singleton injectable cat
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	 is needed
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	The return value is stored and the same value is returned each time
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	 In effect, this is a lazily initialized version of #  """  return Object  @Injectable.named 'dog' def ProvidePitbull  :  """Provides an injectable dog
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In effect, the injectable foo is a singleton object.	 the injectable key has been explicity set to 
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Modules?	Injection modules? We don't need no stinking injection modules.In dPy, Python modules serve as our injection modules
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Modules?	Provide whatever you want in your regular ol' module using the methods above and when you want to switch out the implementation, you can just switch which module you import.Of course, you can also setup injectables behind conditionals if you like.Modules may import their own dependencies or you might prefer to defer importing all your dependencies in a "main" module  or other organization 
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Modules?	As long as all the dependencies are established at runtime, there's no problem.Testing is quite simple in dPy
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Modules?	The only concept dPy has of modules is as regular Python modules
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Modules?	There are no special injection modules
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Modules?	For a full, working example test, check out example_test.py.In the normal mode, injections are automatically passed in for you to things labeled Inject or Injectable.In test mode, this functionality is turned off!Only normal arguments, or _specifically_ test injections may be used in test.@Injectable.value 'bar', 'cat' def Foo bar=IN : print len bar  Foo    # Normally, this prints 3
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	In test mode, this would raise an exception about expecting injection to occur.	Foo bar='test'   # In test mode  and normal mode , this prints
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Enable test mode	Enabling test mode is one call in your test.It may not be turned off once enabled, so feel free to put it at the top level of your test module.You might need to create special test injections depending on how you've structured your code.Setting them up is straight-forward:
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Things injected should be injected.	This prevents having to setup injections for test.Injecting objects that are themselves injected is not required but alleviates the need to setup injections for test which may be confusing.
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't rely on injections for test.	It's best not to have to setup test injections
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't rely on injections for test.	You should only need to use it when private methods are injected or call other injectable functions/constructors
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't rely on injections for test.	In general, you should stick to injecting public methods
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't rely on injections for test.	If you are using a lot of injections for test, it may be a sign of bad program design.
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	Dependency injection should be easy, not stressful
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	It's not a license for spaghetti code
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	Treat injections as called constructors
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	Don't overuse them, don't overthink them
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	Use them when they make sense
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	Use them when they'll make testing easier
google-readmegoogle-dpy.md	Don't inject too much.	Use them when they'll make your life easier, not the opposite!
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	===========Draco is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric  meshes  and point clouds 
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	It is intended to improve the storage and transmission of 3DDraco was designed and built for compression efficiency and speed
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	The codesupports compressing points, connectivity information, texture coordinates,color information, normals, and any other generic attributes associated withgeometry
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	With Draco, applications using 3D graphics can be significantlysmaller without compromising visual fidelity
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	For users, this means apps cannow be downloaded faster, 3D graphics in the browser can load quicker, and VRand AR scenes can now be transmitted with a fraction of the bandwidth andrendered quickly.Draco is released as C++ source code that can be used to compress 3D graphicsas well as C++ and Javascript decoders for the encoded data.========For all platforms, you must first generate the project/make files and thencompile the examples.CMake BasicsTo generate project/make files for the default toolchain on your system, runcmake from a directory where you would like to generate build files, and passit the path to your Draco repository.~~~~~ bashOn Windows, the above command will produce Visual Studio project files for thenewest Visual Studio detected on the system
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	On Mac OS X and Linux systems,the above command will produce a makefile.To control what types of projects are generated, add the cmake command
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	This argument must be followed by the name of a generator.Running cmake with the --help argument will list the availablegenerators for your system.Mac OS XOn Mac OS X, run the following command to generate Xcode projects:~~~~~ bash-------On a Windows box you would run the following command to generate Visual Studio2015 projects:~~~~~ bashC:\Users\nobody> cmake path/to/draco -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"To generate 64-bit Windows Visual Studio 2015 projects:~~~~~ bashC:\Users\nobody> cmake path/to/draco -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"CMake Build ConfigurationDebugging and OptimizationUnlike Visual Studio and Xcode projects, the build configuration for makebuilds is controlled when you run cmake
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	The following examples demonstratevarious build configurations.Omitting the build type produces makefiles that use release build flagsby default:~~~~~ bashA makefile using release  optimized  flags is produced like this:~~~~~ bashA release build with debug info can be produced as well:~~~~~ bashAnd your standard debug build will be produced using:~~~~~ bashTo enable the use of sanitizers when the compiler in use supports them, set thesanitizer type when running CMake:~~~~~ bashGoogletest IntegrationDraco includes testing support built using Googletest
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	To enable Googletest unittest support the ENABLE_TESTS cmake variable must be turned on at cmakegeneration time:~~~~~ bashWhen cmake is used as shown in the above example the Draco cmake file assumesthat the Googletest source directory is a sibling of the Draco repository
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Version 1.3.0 release	Tochange the location to something else use the GTEST_SOURCE_DIR cmake variable:~~~~~ bashTo run the tests just execute draco_tests from your toolchain's build outputJavascript Encoder/DecoderThe javascript encoder and decoder can be built using the existing cmake buildfile by passing the path the Emscripten's cmake toolchain file at cmakegeneration time in the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable.In addition, the EMSCRIPTEN environment variable must be set to the local pathof the parent directory of the Emscripten tools directory.~~~~~ bash
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Build the Javascript encoder and decoder.	WebAssembly DecoderThe WebAssembly decoder can be built using the existing cmake build file bypassing the path the Emscripten's cmake toolchain file at cmake generation timein the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable and enabling the WASM build option.In addition, the EMSCRIPTEN environment variable must be set to the local pathof the parent directory of the Emscripten tools directory.Make sure to have the correct version of Emscripten installed for WebAssemblybuilds
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Build the Javascript encoder and decoder.	See ~~~~~ bash
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	Run the Javascript wrapper through Closure.	WebAssembly Mesh Only Decoder~~~~~ bash
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	cmake command line for mesh only WebAssembly decoder.	WebAssembly Point Cloud Only Decoder~~~~~ bash
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	cmake command line for point cloud only WebAssembly decoder.	Android Studio Project IntegrationTo include Draco in an existing or new Android Studio project, reference itfrom the cmake file of an existing native project that has a minimum SDKversion of 18 or higher
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	cmake command line for point cloud only WebAssembly decoder.	The project must support C++To add Draco to your project:  Add macro to build.gradle for the features you need:Native Android BuildsIt's sometimes useful to build Draco command line tools and run them directly onAndroid devices via adb.~~~~~ bash
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	After building the tools they can be moved to an android device via the use ofadb push, and then run within an adb shell instance.======Command Line ApplicationsThe default target created from the build files will be the draco_encoderand draco_decoder command line applications
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	For both applications, if yourun them without any arguments or -h, the applications will output usage andEncoding Tooldraco_encoder will read OBJ or PLY files as input, and output Draco-encodedfiles
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	We have included Stanford's  Bunny  mesh for testing
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	The basic commandline looks like this:~~~~~ bash./draco_encoder -i testdata/bun_zipper.ply -o out.drcA value of 0 for the quantization parameter will not perform any quantizationon the specified attribute
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	Any value other than 0 will quantize the inputvalues for the specified attribute to that number of bits
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	For example:~~~~~ bash./draco_encoder -i testdata/bun_zipper.ply -o out.drc -qp 14will quantize the positions to 14 bits  default for the position coordinates .In general, the more you quantize your attributes the better compression rateyou will get
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	It is up to your project to decide how much deviation it willtolerate
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	In general, most projects can set quantization values of about 14without any noticeable difference in quality.The compression level  -cl  parameter turns on/off different compression~~~~~ bash./draco_encoder -i testdata/bun_zipper.ply -o out.drc -cl 8In general, the highest setting, 10, will have the most compression butworst decompression speed
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	0 will have the least compression, but bestdecompression speed
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	The default setting is 7.Encoding Point CloudsYou can encode point cloud data with -point_cloud parameter
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	If you specify the -point_cloud parameter with amesh input file, draco_encoder will ignore the connectivity data and encodethe positions from the mesh file.~~~~~ bash./draco_encoder -point_cloud -i testdata/bun_zipper.ply -o out.drcThis command line will encode the mesh input as a point cloud, even though theinput might not produce compression that is representative of other pointclouds
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	Specifically, one can expect much better compression rates for largerand denser point clouds.Decoding Tooldraco_decoder will read Draco files as input, and output OBJ or PLY files.The basic command line looks like this:~~~~~ bash./draco_decoder -i in.drc -o out.objC++ Decoder APIIf you'd like to add decoding to your applications you will need to includethe DecodePointCloudFromBuffer   to return a decoded PointCloud object
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	For~~~~~ cppdraco::DecoderBuffer buffer;buffer.Init data.data  , data.size   ;const draco::EncodedGeometryType geom_type =if  geom_type == draco::TRIANGULAR_MESH  {  unique_ptr mesh = draco::DecodeMeshFromBuffer &buffer ;} else if  geom_type == draco::POINT_CLOUD  {  unique_ptr pc = draco::DecodePointCloudFromBuffer &buffer ;~~~~~Please see  src/draco/mesh/mesh.h  src/draco/mesh/mesh.h  for the full Mesh class interface and src/draco/point_cloud/point_cloud.h  src/draco/point_cloud/point_cloud.h  for the full PointCloud class interface.Javascript Encoder APIAPI can be used to compress mesh and point cloud
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	In order to use the encoder,you need to first create an instance of AddFloatAttributeToMesh   to add attribute data to the mesh, e.g
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	position,normal, color and texture coordinates
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	After a mesh is constructed, you couldthen use EncodeMeshToDracoBuffer   to compress the mesh
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	For example:~~~~~ jsconst mesh = {  indices : new Uint32Array indices ,  vertices : new Float32Array vertices ,  normals : new Float32Array normals const encoderModule = DracoEncoderModule  ;const encoder = new encoderModule.Encoder  ;const meshBuilder = new encoderModule.MeshBuilder  ;const dracoMesh = new encoderModule.Mesh  ;const numFaces = mesh.indices.length / 3;const numPoints = mesh.vertices.length;meshBuilder.AddFacesToMesh dracoMesh, numFaces, mesh.indices ;meshBuilder.AddFloatAttributeToMesh dracoMesh, encoderModule.POSITION,  numPoints, 3, mesh.vertices ;if  mesh.hasOwnProperty 'normals'   {  meshBuilder.AddFloatAttributeToMesh if  mesh.hasOwnProperty 'colors'   {  meshBuilder.AddFloatAttributeToMesh if  mesh.hasOwnProperty 'texcoords'   {  meshBuilder.AddFloatAttributeToMesh if  method === "edgebreaker"  {  encoder.SetEncodingMethod encoderModule.MESH_EDGEBREAKER_ENCODING ;} else if  method === "sequential"  {  encoder.SetEncodingMethod encoderModule.MESH_SEQUENTIAL_ENCODING ;const encodedData = new encoderModule.DracoInt8Array  ;// Use default encoding setting.const encodedLen = encoder.EncodeMeshToDracoBuffer dracoMesh,encoderModule.destroy dracoMesh ;encoderModule.destroy encoder ;encoderModule.destroy meshBuilder ;Please see  src/draco/javascript/emscripten/draco_web_encoder.idl  src/draco/javascript/emscripten/draco_web_encoder.idl  for the full API.Javascript Decoder APIThe Javascript decoder is located in  javascript/draco_decoder.js  javascript/draco_decoder.js 
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	TheJavascript decoder can decode mesh and point cloud
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	In order to use thedecoder, you must first create an instance of DecodeBufferToMesh   or DecodeBufferToPointCloud  , which will returna Mesh object or a point cloud
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	For example:~~~~~ js// Create the Draco decoder.const decoderModule = DracoDecoderModule  ;const buffer = new decoderModule.DecoderBuffer  ;buffer.Init byteArray, byteArray.length ;// Create a buffer to hold the encoded data.const decoder = new decoderModule.Decoder  ;const geometryType = decoder.GetEncodedGeometryType buffer ;// Decode the encoded geometry.let outputGeometry;let status;if  geometryType == decoderModule.TRIANGULAR_MESH  {  outputGeometry = new decoderModule.Mesh  ;  status = decoder.DecodeBufferToMesh buffer, outputGeometry ;} else {  outputGeometry = new decoderModule.PointCloud  ;  status = decoder.DecodeBufferToPointCloud buffer, outputGeometry ;// You must explicitly delete objects created from the DracoDecoderModule// or Decoder.decoderModule.destroy outputGeometry ;decoderModule.destroy decoder ;decoderModule.destroy buffer ;Please see  src/draco/javascript/emscripten/draco_web_decoder.idl  src/draco/javascript/emscripten/draco_web_decoder.idl  for the full API.Javascript Decoder PerformanceThe Javascript decoder is built with dynamic memory
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	This will let the decoderwork with all of the compressed data
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	But this option is not the fastest.Pre-allocating the memory sees about a 2x decoder speed improvement
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	If youknow all of your project's memory requirements, you can turn on static memoryby changing CMakeLists.txt accordingly.Metadata APIother than geometry
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	It could be used to encode any custom data along with thegeometry
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	For example, we can enable metadata functionality to encode the nameof attributes, name of sub-objects and customized information.For one mesh and point cloud, it can have one top-level geometry metadata class.The top-level metadata then can have hierarchical metadata
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	Other than that,the top-level metadata can have metadata for each attribute which is calledattribute metadata
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	The attribute metadata should be initialized with thecorrespondent attribute id within the mesh
google-readmegoogle-draco.md	x86_64	The metadata API is provided bothin C++ and Javascript.For example, to add metadata in C++:~~~~~ cppdraco::PointCloud pc;// Add metadata for the geometry.std::unique_ptr metadata =  std::unique_ptr new draco::GeometryMetadata   ;metadata->AddEntryString "description", "This is an example." ;pc.AddMetadata std::move metadata  ;// Add metadata for attributes.draco::GeometryAttribute pos_att;pos_att.Init draco::GeometryAttribute::POSITION, nullptr, 3,const uint32_t pos_att_id = pc.AddAttribute pos_att, false, 0 ;std::unique_ptr pos_metadata =pos_metadata->AddEntryString "name", "position" ;// Directly add attribute metadata to geometry.// You can do this without explicitly add |GeometryMetadata| to mesh.pc.AddAttributeMetadata pos_att_id, std::move pos_metadata  ;To read metadata from a geometry in C++:~~~~~ cpp// Get metadata for the geometry.const draco::GeometryMetadata *pc_metadata = pc.GetMetadata  ;// Request metadata for a specific attribute.const draco::AttributeMetadata *requested_pos_metadata =  pc.GetAttributeMetadataByStringEntry "name", "position" ;Please see  src/draco/metadata  src/draco/metadata  and  src/draco/point_cloud  src/draco/point_cloud  for the full API.NPM Packagedoc in the folder for detailed usage.three.js Renderer ExampleHere's an  example  of a geometric compressed with Draco loaded via aJavascript decoder using the three.js renderer.Please see the  javascript/example/README.md  javascript/example/README.md  file for more information.=======For questions/comments please email If you have found an error in this library, please file an issue atPatches are encouraged, and may be submitted by forking this project andsubmitting a pull request through GitHub

google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Polyfill for the removed HTML5 dropzone attribute	This is not an official Google product.This is a polyfill intended to help sites impacted by the removal of webkitdropzone from Chromium 
google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Usage	If your Web application's drag-and-drop functionality works in Firefox, Edge,or any other browser that is not based on Blink or WebKit, stop reading now.You do not need this polyfill.If you're still here, the quickest way to get your site working again is todownload  lib/dropzone-polyfill.js  lib/dropzone-polyfill.js  and include it inyour site's JavaScript bundler, then call DropzonePolyfill.handleDom   afteryour DOM is ready
google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Usage	For example, imperative API for handling drops This polyfill is way more complex than the code you'll have to write for yourown application, due to the need of handling the entire dropzone syntax.The code needed to replace webkitdropzone can be as simple as:
google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Limitations	In Safari and Firefox, the polyfill is not able to obtain the MIME type ofdragged files at the time needed to implement the filters expressed by file:tokens in the dropzone attribute
google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Limitations	The polyfill errs on the side of falsepositives, by having any dragged file match against any file: token.For example, if a Safari user drags a HTML file over an element with adragzone attribute set to file:text/plain, the polyfill will decide that thedragged file matches the dragzone conditions
google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Limitations	However, the polyfill will notmatch non-file drags to the dragzone value above.On the other hand, it is worth noting that dropzone / webkitdropzone werenever implemented in Firefox so, if your application relies on these attributes,it is already broken in Firefox
google-readmegoogle-dropzone-polyfill.md	Limitations	Along the same lines, the webkitdropzone inChrome was unable to match file: tokens against dragged files, until MIn conclusion, if you wish to accept file drags in a portable manner, you needto use the imperative API for handling drops

google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	easy-grid for React	***This is not an official Google product.***easy-grid is a React component factory that provides a declarative layout mechanism for utilizing  CSS grid layouts  It uses ASCII layout descriptions to generate layout components that arrange child components according to the defined grid.																														
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Prerequisites	Make sure you have the  npm package manager  installed on your development machine.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Installing	Clone the git repository to a local directory:To play around with the library, make changes to the  examples.js  React app and re-run npm run examples.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Running the tests	To use the library in a production environment, simply run:easy-grid exports a grid factory method:The exported grid method is used to create layout components based on an ASCII representations of the desired layout grid
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Running the tests	For instance:const TwoByTwoLayout = grid1fr A1fr A~~~defines a React component, TwoByTwoLayout, that will distribute it's child elements along a two by two grid
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Running the tests	element "A" will take up the entire grid, while element "B" will overlap element "A" and take up the right half of the grid
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Running the tests	The two rows will each have the same height, namely half the height of the parent element
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Running the tests	Likewise, the two columns will each have the same width, or half the width of the parent component.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Definition Syntax	Grids are defined by a back-tick    string
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Definition Syntax	Spaces and new-lines are non-trivial as they are used to parse the grid definition from the string.Row and column header definitions use the syntax defined for  grid-template-rows  **Type**Flex*Length
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Column Headers	The first line of the string is a space-delimited definition of **column headers**
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Column Headers	A component can be defined by only using column headers
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Column Headers	For instance,defines a ColumnsOnly component that will arrange its children in 3 columns
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Column Headers	The first and last column will be half the size of the middle column.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Row Headers	Each line after the first line defines a new row in the grid
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Row Headers	The first element in the space-deilimited row definition defines the height of that row, and is called the **row header**
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Row Headers	However, similar to column-only grid definitions, row-only grid defintions can be created by only specifying row headers on each new line
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Row Headers	For instance,defines a RowsOnly component that will give each of its three child components heights of 10 pixels, 50 pixels and 100 pixels respectively.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Areas	Using a combination of column headers and row headers, a grid is defined
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Areas	The cells of the grid should be used to define **grid areas**
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Areas	Grid areas are continuous square areas defined by an arbitrary identifier being placed in a **grid cell**
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Areas	For example, the following grid defines two grid areas, one denoted by "A" and one denoted by "B".Grid area defintions use commas to separate multiple overlapping grid areas identifiers in a given grid cell.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Overlap	Grid areas can overlap, as seen in the example above
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Overlap	This overlap defines a z-ordering
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Overlap	When rendered, an area will be drawn on top of any area it overlaps
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Overlap	**Grid areas are alphabetically ordered
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Overlap	Later areas will be rendered on top of earlier ones.*
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Empty Cells	Empty grid cells can be denoted by ..
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Empty Cells	For instance,defines a SpacerGrid component that has a single grid area with a 10px border around it.
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Component	As mentioned above, the result of calling the grid factory method with a grid definition is a React component
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Component	The returned component has the following expectations:					Grid components can also be styled via the className property
google-readmegoogle-easy-grid.md	Grid Component	If your project is using  styled components  the returned grid component can also be styled using the styled method:	background-color: red;

google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Easy GWT Mock  #	_Easy GWT Mock_ is an EasyMock-like mocking framework for  Google Web Toolkit  which allows the creation of mock objects within GWTTestCase
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Easy GWT Mock  #	Feature and syntax-wise it is a lot like  EasyMock  However, there are three main differences:
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Integrating _Easy GWT Mock_ in Your Project ##	Checkout the sources and executeThat's it! You are ready to use _Easy GWT Mock_.
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Create Your First Mock ##	Let’s get started! Imagine, you want to mock the following type  in this case, an interface :ctrl.expect mock.add 2, 3  .andReturn 5 .once  ;// Like in EasyMock, once   is the default so you can leave it out:ctrl.expect mock.add 1, 1  .andReturn 2 ;ctrl.expect mock.add 4, 2  .andReturn 6 .anyTimes  ;ctrl.expect mock.add 6, 2  .andReturn 8 .times 2 ;ctrl.expect mock.add 2, 1  .andReturn 3 .times 4, 6 ;// Use expectLastCall   for void methods:mock.doSomething "Hello" ;ctrl.expectLastCall  .atLeastOnce  ;// chaining expectations is also possible:ctrl.expect mock.add 4, 2  .andReturn 6 .andReturn 3 ;// ..
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Create Your First Mock ##	is equivalent to:ctrl.expect mock.add 4, 2  .andReturn 6 ;ctrl.expect mock.add 4, 2  .andReturn 3 ;ctrl.replay  ;// ..
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Create Your First Mock ##	 interact with the mock ctrl.verify  ;That’s it! If you want to learn more about the semantic of anyTimes  , expectLastCall  , once  , etc
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Create Your First Mock ##	see the  EasyMock documentation 
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Using Argument Matchers ##	Sometimes you do not want to specify the exact value of an argument
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Using Argument Matchers ##	That is where argument matchers are useful
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Using Argument Matchers ##	Use argument matchers to specify that you expect an argument to be within a certain range:Have a lock at the MocksControl interface to learn which argument matchers are currently available
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Using Argument Matchers ##	If there is no matcher that fits your use case, then fear not because you can create your own matcher!
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Create Your Own Argument Matcher ##	Create a class that implements the public class IsOdd implements ArgumentMatcher {  }  }
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Capture Arguments for Later Use ##	Sometimes you want to hold on to an argument passed to a mock method
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Capture Arguments for Later Use ##	You can do that with captures
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Capture Arguments for Later Use ##	Just create a Capture addend = new Capture;mock.add ctrl.captureInt addend , ctrl.eq 4  ;// do something with the mockaddend.getFirstValue  ; // returns the first value capturedaddend.getLastValue  ;  // returns the last value capturedaddend.getValues  ;
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Throwing Exceptions ##	You can throw an exception as a reaction to a mock method call by using 
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Calling onSuccess   or onFailure   ##	Asynchronous callbacks are quite common in GWT applications If your callback object does not implement the AsyncCallback interface, use the more generic Answer described in the next section to invoke your callback.
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	More Sophisticated Responses ##	Sometimes you actually want to do something more sophisticated than just returning a value or throwing an exception
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	More Sophisticated Responses ##	For example, you might want to call a callback in reaction to a method call
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	More Sophisticated Responses ##	You can do that and much more with the help of Caution: Using the method’s arguments within an Answer is not refactoring-safe!Word of advice: If your callback implements GWT’s AsyncCallback interface you should not use Answer and instead use the easier way described in the previous section.
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Nice Mocks ##	Mocks throw an exception in response to an unexpected method call as default behavior
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Nice Mocks ##	However, there are situations where you want a “nice” mock that returns appropriate default values  {{0}}}, 
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Object’s equal  , hasCode   and toString   methods ##	You cannot mock the following basic methods of java.lang.Object: equals  , toString  , hashCode  
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Object’s equal  , hasCode   and toString   methods ##	For your convenience, we have provided a default implementation for those methods
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Object’s equal  , hasCode   and toString   methods ##	This makes it easier to add mocks to collections which might make an arbitrary amount of equals   and hashCode   calls to the mock
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Object’s equal  , hasCode   and toString   methods ##	The default toString   implementation makes it easy for exceptions to display a string representation of the mock.
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Limited Class Mocking  coming soon  ##	The main focus of _Easy GWT Mock_ is on mocking interfaces
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Limited Class Mocking  coming soon  ##	Class mocking is somewhat limited because due to the way GWT and Java work the mock is actually a subclass of the class to mock
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Limited Class Mocking  coming soon  ##	Please keep the following limitations in mind when mocking classes:
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Frequently Asked Questions  FAQ  ##	**_Where should I put the interface extending MocksControl that defines which classes I want to mock?_**As you can see in the tests for the framework I usually implement the interface as an inner type right inside the test classes where I need the mocks
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Frequently Asked Questions  FAQ  ##	That way, I end up with one interface per test class that only contains the mocks I need for that class
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Frequently Asked Questions  FAQ  ##	Other people have suggested to have just one interface for all your tests which includes all classes you want to mock.
google-readmegoogle-easy-gwt-mock.md	Differences between EasyMock and _Easy GWT Mock_ ##	Here is an  incomplete  list of the differences between _Easy GWT Mock_ and EasyMock:_Easy GWT Mock_ has some special GWT related features which are not part of EasyMock:The following features are available in EasyMock, but they are not  yet  implemented in _Easy GWT Mock_:Special thanks to the guys who created  EasyMock 
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	EasyBundler	EasyBundler is a library to simplify converting state objects into Bundles for Android applications.This repository is also a demonstration of simple annotation processing for Android libraries.
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Download	In order to use EasyBundler you will need to add a compile dependency for the API as wellas an annotationProcessor dependency for the compiler:First, define a simple state class in your application and annotate it with @BundlerClass:@BundlerClasspublic class MyState {There are a few important requirements for a state object to work with EasyBundler:public final class MyStateBundler {  public static Bundle toBundle MyState object  {  }  }You can use the Bundler class directly in your application, but it's even easier to usethe helper methods provided by EasyBundler.For example to serialize an object to Bundle, use the EasyBundler.toBundle Object  method.And to turn that Bundle back into an object, use the EasyBundler.fromBundle Bundle, Class method
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Download	Both of these methods will fail if there is no generated Bundler class available.If you are passing objects through Intents, you can use the EasyBundler.putExtra Intent, Object and EasyBundler.fromIntent Intent, Class  methods to quickly add objects to and retrieve objectsfrom an Intent.
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Is EasyBundler efficient?	EasyBundler does most of the heavy lifting at compile time to generate the Bundler classes,so bundling and unbundling objects should be very fast due to the limited use of reflection atruntime
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Is EasyBundler efficient?	If you want to maximize efficiency by eliminating all reflection, use the Bundler classesdirectly rather than the EasyBundler helper methods  which have to do a Class lookup atruntime to find the Bundler classes .
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Can I customize how EasyBundler serializes and deserializes?	Not yet! But if you have a use case that is blocked by the lack of customization please open an Issue so we can discuss it.
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Does EasyBundler support inheritance?	No, the current version of EasyBundler only looks at properties of the annotated class, not itsparent class es .
google-readmegoogle-easybundler.md	Publishing	To install the library to your mavenLocal   repository, run:

google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Introduction	Enjarify is a tool for translating Dalvik bytecode to equivalent Java bytecode
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Introduction	This allows Java analysis tools to analyze Android applications.
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage and installation	Enjarify is a pure python 3 application, so you can just git clone and run it
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage and installation	To run it directly, assuming you are in the top directory of the repository, you can just doFor normal use, you'll probably want to use the wrapper scripts and set it up on your path.
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Linux	For convenience, a wrapper shell script is provided, enjarify.sh
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Linux	This will try to use Pypy if available, since it is faster than CPython
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Linux	If you want to be able to call Enjarify from anywhere, you can create a symlink from somewhere on your PATH, such as ~/bin
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Linux	To do this, assuming you are inside the top level of the repository,
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Windows	A wrapper batch script, enjarify.bat, is provided
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Windows	To be able to call it from anywhere, just add the root directory of the repository to your PATH
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Windows	The batch script will always invoke python3 as interpreter
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Windows	If you want to use pypy, just edit the script.
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	Assuming you set up the script on your path correctly, you can call it from anywhere by just typing enjarify, e.g.The most basic form of usage is to just specify an apk file or dex file as input
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	If you specify a multidex apk, Enjarify will automatically translate all of the dex files and output the results in a single combined jar
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	If you specify a dex file, only that dex file will be translated
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	E.g
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	assuming you manually extracted the dex files you could doThe default output file is  inputname -enjarify.jar in the current directory
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	To specify the filename for the output explicitly, pass the -o or --output option.By default, Enjarify will refuse to overwrite the output file if it already exists
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Usage	To overwrite the output, pass the -f or --force option.
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Why not dex2jar?	Dex2jar is an older tool that also tries to translate Dalvik to Java bytecode
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Why not dex2jar?	It works reasonable well most of the time, but a lot of obscure features or edge cases will cause it to fail or even silently produce incorrect results
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Why not dex2jar?	By contrast, Enjarify is designed to work in as many cases as possible, even for code where Dex2jar would fail
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Why not dex2jar?	Among other things, Enjarify correctly handles unicode class names, constants used as multiple types, implicit casts, exception handlers jumping into normal control flow, classes that reference too many constants, very long methods, exception handlers after a catchall handler, and static initial values of the wrong type.
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Limitations	Enjarify does not currently translate optional metadata such as sourcefile attributes, line numbers, and annotations.Enjarify tries hard to successfully translate as many classes as possible, but there are some potential cases where it is simply not possible due to limitations in Android, Java, or both
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Limitations	Luckily, this only happens in contrived circumstances, so it shouldn't be a problem in practice.
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Performance tips	PyPy is much faster than CPython
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Performance tips	To install PyPy, see  Make sure you get PyPy3 rather than regular PyPy
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Performance tips	The Linux wrapper script will automatically use the command pypy3 if available
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Performance tips	On Windows, you'll need to edit the wrapper script yourself.By default, Enjarify runs optimizations on the bytecode which make it more readable for humans  copy propagation, unused value removal, etc
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Performance tips	If you don't need this, you can speed things up by disabling the optimizations with the --fast option
google-readmegoogle-enjarify.md	Performance tips	Note that in the very rare case where a class is too big to fit in a classfile without optimization, Enjarify will automatically retry it with all optimizations enabled, so this option does not affect the number of classes that are successfully translated.

google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	Using Episodes	Add the episodes package to your pubspec.yaml file, selecting a version rangethat works with your version of the SDK
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	Using Episodes	For example:packages:episodes/episodes.dart
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	Using Episodes	This library exposes the Episodes class,which contains methods you can use to instrument your code.You can call mark   to mark points in time, or call measure   to recordintervals between two such points
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	Using Episodes	You can later extract the results as a graphicaltimeline in HTML, as HTML tables, or you can send them to a listener viaThere is an associated Reporter class for listening to the window.postMessagenotifications
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	Using Episodes	This can be customized in suitable ways
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	Using Episodes	For example, the defaultcase is like the original episodes library; there is also a  YahooBoomerang  boomerang  compatible reporter available.
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	This package follows  semantic versioning  semver 
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	Prior to 1.0, wefollow a similar scheme to semantic versioning
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	 We treat the 'patch' number asthe 'minor' version, and use + as a patch
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	So a change from 0.3.0 to 0.3.0+1 isa non-breaking change, but a change from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1 is considered a breakingchange
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	Additionally we try to match the minor version with the currentmilestone from the Dart SDK
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	The first release of episodes is versioned as 0.3.0because it was developed under the first M3 release of the Dart SDK
google-readmegoogle-episodes.dart.md	A note about versions	If Dart M4has breaking changes, our library at that point will jump to version 0

google-readmegoogle-etc2comp.md	Command Line Usage	 "rgbx" calculates RMS error using RGBA components, where A is treated as an additional data channel, instead of as alpha
google-readmegoogle-etc2comp.md	Command Line Usage	 "rec709" is similar to "rgba", except the RGB components are also weighted according to Rec "numeric" calculates RMS error using unweighted RGBA components
google-readmegoogle-etc2comp.md	Command Line Usage	 "normalize" calculates error based on dot product and vector length for RGB and RMS error for A.source image
google-readmegoogle-etc2comp.md	Command Line Usage	 The mipmaps are generated with a lanczos3 filter using edge clamping.If the mipmaps option is not specified no mipmaps are created.are "x", "y" and "xy" which specify wrapping in x only, y only or x and y respectively.The default options are clamping in both x and y.Note: Path names can use slashes or backslashes
google-readmegoogle-etc2comp.md	Command Line Usage	 The tool will convert the slashes to the appropriate polarity for the current platform.
google-readmegoogle-etc2comp.md	API	The library supports two different APIs class-based and a class-based API.main   in EtcTool.cpp contains an example of both APIs.The Encode   method now returns an EncodingStatus that contains bit flags forreporting various warnings and flags encountered when encoding.

google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	A Rust library for compiling and matching regular expressions
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	It uses a hybridregex implementation designed to support a relatively rich set of features.In particular, it uses backtracking to implement "fancy" features such aslook-around and backtracking, which are not supported in purelyNFA-based implementations  exemplified by RE2  and implemented in Rust in the regex  crate 
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	! crate   ! build status   ! codecov  A goal is to be as efficient as possible
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	For a given regex, the NFAimplementation has asymptotic running time linear in the length of theinput, while in the general case a backtracking implementation hasexponential blowup
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	An example given in  Static Analysis for RegularExpression Exponential Runtime via SubstructuralLogics  is:doubles for each additional repeat of 'ab'.Thus, many proponents advocate  a purely NFA nondeterministic finite automaton  based approach
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	Even so,backreferences and look-around do add richness to regexes, and theyare commonly used in applications such as syntax highlighting for texteditors
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	In particular, TextMate's  syntaxdefinitions based on the  Oniguruma backtracking engine, are now used in a number of other populareditors, including Sublime Text and Atom
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	These syntax definitionsroutinely use backreferences and look-around
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	For example, thefollowing regex captures a single-line Rust raw string:a backtracking implementation handles it efficiently.This package is one of the first that handles both cases well
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	Theexponential blowup case above is run in 258ns
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	fancy-regex	Thus, it should be avery appealing alternative for applications that require both richnessand performance.
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A warning about worst-case performance	NFA-based approaches give strong guarantees about worst-caseperformance
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A warning about worst-case performance	For regexes that contain "fancy" features such asbackreferences and look-around, this module gives no correspondingguarantee
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A warning about worst-case performance	If an attacker can control the regular expressions thatwill be matched against, they will be able to successfully mount adenial-of-service attack
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A warning about worst-case performance	Be warned.See  PERFORMANCE.md  PERFORMANCE.md  for some examples.
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A hybrid approach	One workable approach is to detect the presence of "fancy" features,and choose either an NFA implementation or a backtracker depending onwhether they are used.However, this module attempts to be more fine-grained
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A hybrid approach	Instead, itimplements a true hybrid approach
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A hybrid approach	In essence, it is a backtracking VM as well explained in  Regular Expression Matching: the VirtualMachine Approach  inwhich one of the "instructions" in the VM delegates to an inner NFAimplementation  in Rust, the regex crate, though a similar approachwould certainly be possible using RE2 or the Go regexp  package 
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A hybrid approach	Then there's ananalysis which decides for each subexpression whether it is "hard", orcan be delegated to the NFA matcher
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	A hybrid approach	At the moment, it is eager, anddelegates as much as possible to the NFA engine.
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	** This section is written in a somewhat informal style; I hope toexpand on it **The fundamental idea is that it's a backtracking VM like PCRE, but asmuch as possible it delegates to an "inner" RE engine like RE2  inthis case, the Rust one 
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	For the sublanguage not using fancyfeatures, the library becomes a thin wrapper.Otherwise, you do an analysis to figure out what you can delegate andwhat you have to backtrack
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	I was thinking it might be tricky, butit's actually quite simple
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	The first phase, you just label eachsubexpression as "hard"  groups that get referenced in a backref,look-around, etc , and bubble that up
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	You also do a little extraanalysis, mostly determining whether an expression has constant matchlength, and the minimum length.The second phase is top down, and you carry a context, also a booleanindicating whether it's "hard" or not
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	Intuitively, a hard context isone in which the match length will affect future backtracking.If the subexpression is easy and the context is easy, generate aninstruction in the VM that delegates to the inner NFA implementation.Otherwise, generate VM code as in a backtracking engine
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	Mostexpression nodes are pretty straightforward; the only interesting caseis concat  a sequence of subexpressions .Even that one is not terribly complex
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	First, determine a prefix ofeasy nodes of constant match length  this won't affect backtracking,so safe to delegate to NFA 
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	Then, if your context is easy, determinea suffix of easy nodes
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	Both of these delegate to NFA
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	For the ones inbetween, recursively compile
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	In an easy context, the last of thesealso gets an easy context; everything else is generated in a hardcontext
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Theory	So, conceptually, hard context flows from right to left, andfrom parents to children.
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Current status	Still in development, though the basic ideas are in place
google-readmegoogle-fancy-regex.md	Current status	Currently,the following features are missing:Many thanks to  Andrew Gallant  forstimulating conversations that inspired this approach, as well as forcreating the excellent regex crate.

google-readmegoogle-favcolor-server.md	FavColor server	A demo app for a variety of identity technologies, including OAuth 2, OpenID COnnect, and Persona.
google-readmegoogle-favcolor-server.md	favcolor.net	Integrates with the Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Mozilla Persona IDPs
google-readmegoogle-favcolor-server.md	favcolor.net	 Mostly OAuth 2.0-based, except for Facebook is subtly incompatible and Personais something completely different.
google-readmegoogle-favcolor-server.md	favcolor.net/gat	Integrates with the Google “Identity Toolkit” software, which takes care of all the user management stuff, including passwords, recovery, and federation with lots of IDPs.
google-readmegoogle-favcolor-server.md	components	This is the server side of the code, a Ruby/Sinatra thing which uses filesystem storage with some help from memcached.Also, there’s an Android client at  and an iOS client at 
google-readmegoogle-fchan-go.md	fchan: Fast Channels in Go	This package contains implementations of fast and scalable channels in Go.Implementation is in bench.go is very rudimentary, and modifying the source may be necessarydepending on what you want to run; that will change in the future

google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Fast Fourier Color Constancy Matlab Toolbox	The Fast Fourier Color Constancy  FFCC  Matlab Toolbox includes the followingEither add this to the path manually or place it inside the root /ffcc/
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Training & Cross Validation	The following section discusses training and cross validation.
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Preparation and Folder Structure	The training folder structure should look similar to the following:The script will parse down the subfolders and look for *.png and *.txt files,which corresponds to the linear thumbnail and the color of global illuminant.This data has been provided for the Gehler-Shi dataset, alongside a scriptfor generating this data "from scratch"  see /ffcc/data/ .
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Linear Thumbnail	The PNG file is usually a small resolution thumbnail with linear data afterblack level removed
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Linear Thumbnail	This is very important since this assumption enables shiftinvariance
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Linear Thumbnail	This PNG file needs to match to the format of your imaging pipeline
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Global Illuminant	The text file descibes the color of the global illuminant
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Global Illuminant	It looks like this:as follows:$$where \\ z =  1/R_{gain}, 1/G_{gain}, 1/B_{gain} \\ .
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Project Folder	To allow FFCC Toolbox to support wide range of projects, we separate out thecore algorithms from the project specific implementations
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Project Folder	The project specificimplementations are placed under projects/ folder.The following scripts all take as input the string of some project name, whichmust correspond exactly to a folder in projects/, and which must prefix allfilenames in the projects/ subfolder.
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Tuning and cross-validation	Tune   performs coordinate descent over hyperparameters, and can also be used tosanity-check the current hyperparameter set as a diagnostic
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Tuning and cross-validation	A side effect oftuning/cross-validation is that it will produce a set of error metrics, of thefollowing form:second element is a surface statistic on that error metric
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Tuning and cross-validation	Please seeCrossValidate.m and ErrorMetrics.m for detailed descriptions.An angular_err less than 2 degrees is not perceptible, and vonmisses_nll isis measured in negative-nats for an individual training point
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Tuning and cross-validation	If the error ismore than 2 degrees, you might consider:  file to be used in later training and tuning, as described in Tune  
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Tuning and cross-validation	Tuning  may be slow, so consider running it overnight or for several days
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Tuning and cross-validation	 group.You can read further tuning description in Tune.m or CrossValidate.m
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Training	Once Tune   is producing reasonable cross-validation results, use Train  to train a final model which will be written to disk
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Training	See Train   for details.
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Visualization	Visualize   provides visualizing and testing functinality
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Visualization	Given a project name,It will do all necessary training  or cross-validation  and produce avisualization for each image
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Visualization	If the project uses cross-validation, then eachimage is evaluated using the model that did not include that image in itstraining fold
google-readmegoogle-ffcc.md	Visualization	If the project uses training/test splits, then all images areevaluated using the model trained on the training set.If params.TRAINING.DUMP_EXHAUSTIVE_VISUALIZATIONis set to true, this script will dump an extensive set of images and filesdescribing the output of the model, which can be useful for debugging.See CrossValidate   for details.
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Flood-Filling Networks	Flood-Filling Networks  FFNs  are a class of neural networks designed forinstance segmentation of complex and large shapes, particularly in volumeEM datasets of brain tissue.For more details, see the related publications: *  * This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Installation	No installation is required, but please ensure that the following dependenciesare available on your system:versions listed above, and equipped with a Tesla P100 GPU.
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Training	FFN networks can be trained with the train.py script, which expects aTFRecord file of coordinates at which to sample data from input volumes.
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	We provide a sample coordinate file for the FIB-25 validation1 volumeincluded in third_party
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	Due to its size, that file is hosted inGoogle Cloud Storage
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	If you haven't used it before, you will need toinstall the Google Cloud SDK and set it up with:There are two scripts to generate training coordinate files fora labeled dataset stored in HDF5 files: build_coordinates.py.compute_partitions.py transforms the label volume into an intermediatevolume where the value of every voxel A corresponds to the quantizedfraction of voxels labeled identically to A within a subvolume ofradius lom_radius centered at A
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	lom_radius should normally beset to  fov_size // 2  + deltas  where fov_size and deltas areFFN model settings 
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	Every such quantized fraction is called a *partition*.Sample invocation:to produce a TFRecord file of coordinates in which every partition isrepresented approximately equally frequently
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	Sample invocation:Once the coordinate files are ready, you can start training the FFN with:computationally expensive processes
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	We recommend a GPU-equipped machinefor best results, particularly when using the FFN interactively in a Jupyternotebook
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Sample data	Training the FFN as configured above requires a GPU with 12 GB of RAM.You can reduce the batch size, model depth, fov_size, or number of features inthe convolutional layers to reduce the memory usage.
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Inference	We provide two examples of how to run inference with a trained FFN model.For a non-interactive setting, you can use the run_inference.py script:contain a segmentation map and quantized probability maps, respectively.In Python, you can load the segmentation as follows:For the training2 volume, segmentation takes ~7 min with a P100 GPU.For an interactive setting, check out ffn_inference_demo.ipynb
google-readmegoogle-ffn.md	Inference	This Jupyternotebook shows how to segment a single object with an explicitly definedseed and visualize the results while inference is running.Both examples are configured to use a 3d convstack FFN model trained on thevalidation1 volume of the FIB-25 dataset from the FlyEM project at Janelia.

google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Linux	Make sure you've installed the following dependencies:extra parameter to cmake:solution is to use update-alternatives to both change the default compiler, and point to aspecific version of clang:
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	macOS	To compile Filament you must have the most recent version of Xcode installed and you need tomake sure the command line tools are setup by running:properly set
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	macOS	If it doesn't already point to the appropriate JDK, you can simply add the followingto your .profile:The following instructions have been tested on a machine running Windows They should take youfrom a machine with only the operating system to a machine able to build and run Filament.Google employees require additional steps which can be found here  go/filawin Install the following components:Create a working directory:Create the msBuild project:Check out the output and make sure Clang for Windows frontend was found
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	macOS	You should see a lineshowing the following ouput.You are now ready to build:Run it:
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Building with Ninja on Windows	Alternatively, you can use  Ninja  to build for Windows
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Building with Ninja on Windows	An MSVCinstallation is still necessary.First, install the dependencies listed under  Windows  #Windows  as well as Ninja
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Building with Ninja on Windows	Then open up aVS2015 x64 Native Tools terminal as before
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Building with Ninja on Windows	Create a build directory inside Filament and run thefollowing CMake command:
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running a simple test	To confirm Filament was properly built, run the following command from the build directory:Before building Filament for Android, make sure to build Filament for your host
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running a simple test	Some of thehost tools are required to successfully build for Android.Filament can be built for the following architectures:foremost for arm64-v8a.
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Linux toolchain	Then invoke CMake in a build directory of your choice, sibling of filament's directory:to build the Android Studio projects located in filament/android
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Linux toolchain	After install, the librarybinaries should be found in out/android-release/filament/lib/x86.
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	AAR	Before you attempt to build the AAR, make sure you've compiled and installed the native librariesas explained in the sections above
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	AAR	You must have the following ABIs built inAAR is a universal AAR that contains all supported build targets:Alternatively you can build the AAR from the command line by executing the following theandroid/filament-android directory:the CMake install prefix used in the previous steps .
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Using Filament's AAR	Create a new module in your project and select _Import .JAR or .AAR Package_ when prompted
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Using Filament's AAR	Makesure to add the newly created module as a dependency to your application.If you do not wish to include all supported ABIs, make sure to create the appropriate flavors inyour Gradle build file
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Using Filament's AAR	For example:As an experimental feature, the core Filament library can be cross-compiled to WebAssembly fromeither macOS or Linux
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Using Filament's AAR	To get started, do the following only once:After this you can invoke our standard build script with -p webgl.
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	The samples/ directory contains several examples of how to use Filament with SDLSome of the samples accept FBX/OBJ meshes while others rely on the filamesh file format
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	Togenerate a filamesh  file from an FBX/OBJ asset, run the filamesh tool ./tools/filamesh/filamesh in your build directory :in your build directory 
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	These sample apps expect a path to a directory containing the RGBM filesfor the IBL
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	To generate an IBL simply use this command:file
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	The environment map can be an equirectangular projection, a horizontal cross, a verticalcross, or a list of cubemap faces  horizontal or vertical .cmgen will automatically create a directory based on the name of the source environment map
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	Inthe example above, the final directory will be ./ibls/my_ibl/
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	This directory should contain thepre-filtered environment map  one file per cubemap face and per mip level , the environment maptexture for the skybox and a text file containing the spherical harmonics for indirect diffuseIf you prefer a blurred background, run cmgen with this flag: --extract-blur=0.5
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Running the samples	The numericalvalue is the desired roughness between 0 and 
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Native Linux, macOS and Windows	You must create an Engine, a Renderer and a SwapChain
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Native Linux, macOS and Windows	The SwapChain is created from anative window pointer  an NSView on macOS or a HDC on Windows for instance :CameraSceneview->setCamera camera ;view->setScene scene ;Renderables are added to the scene:by matc: materials documentation  ./docs/Materials.md.html .To render, simply pass the View to the Renderer:in the samples/ directory
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Native Linux, macOS and Windows	These samples are all based on samples/app/ which contains the codethat creates a native window with SDL2 and initializes the Filament engine, renderer and views.
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Java on Linux, macOS and Windows	After building Filament, you can use filament-java.jar and its companion filament-jni nativelibrary to use Filament in desktop Java applications.You must always first initialize Filament by calling Filament.init  .You can use Filament either with AWT or Swing, using respectively a FilamentPanel.Following the steps above  how to use Filament from native code , create an Renderer, but instead of calling beginFrame and endFrame on the renderer itself, callthese methods on FilamentCanvas or FilamentPanel.
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Android	You must always first initialize Filament by calling Filament.init  .Rendering with Filament on Android is similar to rendering from native code  the APIs are largelythe same across languages 
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Android	You can render into a createSwapChain method
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Android	This allows you to render to a SurfaceTexture, a TextureView ora SurfaceView
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Android	To make things easier we provide an Android specific API called UiHelper in thepackage com.google.android.filament.android
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Android	All you need to do is set a render callback on thehelper and attach your SurfaceView or TextureView to it
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Android	You are still responsible forcreating the swap chain in the onNativeWindowChanged   callback.
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Generating C++ documentation	To generate the documentation you must first install doxygen, then run the following commands:
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Dependencies	One of our design goals is that Filament itself should have no dependencies or as few dependenciesas possible
google-readmegoogle-filament.md	Dependencies	The current external dependencies of the runtime library include:

google-readmegoogle-flexbox-layout.md	Known differences from the original CSS specification	This library tries to achieve the same capabilities of the original Flexible Box specification  as much as possible,but due to some reasons such as the way specifying attributes can't be the same betweenCSS and Android XML, there are some known differences from the original specification

google-readmegoogle-flexbox-layout.md	Known differences from the original CSS specification	layout_flexBasisPercent only accepts percentage values
google-readmegoogle-flexbox-layout.md	Known differences from the original CSS specification	 However, specifying initial fixed width values can be done by specifying width  or height  values in  layout_width  or layout_height, varies depending on the flexDirection 
google-readmegoogle-flexbox-layout.md	Known differences from the original CSS specification	Also, the same  effect can be done by specifying "wrap_content" in layout_width  or layout_height  if  developers want to achieve the same effect as 'content'
google-readmegoogle-flexbox-layout.md	Known differences from the original CSS specification	Thus, layout_flexBasisPercent only  accepts percentage values, which can't be done through layout_width  or layout_height  for  simplicity

google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	What is it?	Flogger is a  fluent  logging APIfor Java
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	What is it?	It supports a wide variety of features, and has ** many benefits *Come for more self-documenting log statements:While some users prefer "fluency" as a style, this is not what the argument forFlogger rests on
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	What is it?	Flogger offers these key, concrete advantages over otherlogging APIs:
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	The field of open-source Java logging APIs is already extremely crowded, so whyadd another?To paraphrase Douglas Adams "Google's codebase is big
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	Really big
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	You justwon’t believe how vastly hugely  mind-bogglinglybig it is"
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	Inevitably this resulted in many different debug logging APIs being usedthroughout the Java codebase, each with its own benefits and issues
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	Developerswere forced to switch between APIs as they worked on different projects, anddifferences between APIs caused confusion and bugs.Flogger is the result of an attempt to create a unified logging API, suitablefor the vast majority of Java projects in Google.For something of this magnitude it would have been preferable to use anexisting logging API, rather than creating and maintaining our own
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	However, theJava Core Libraries Team  i.e
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	Guava maintainers  concluded that Flogger was notslightly better than the alternatives, but much better.By switching the majority of Java code in Google to use Flogger, many thousandsof bugs have been fixed and the cost to developers of learning new logging APIsas they move through the codebase has been eliminated
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Yet another logging API?	Flogger is now the solerecommended Java logging API within Google.
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Add the dependencies on Flogger	All code that uses flogger should depend on> Note: the dependency on flogger-system-backend is only required to beincluded when the binary is run
google-readmegoogle-flogger.md	Add the dependencies on Flogger	If you have a modularized build, you caninclude this dependency by the root module that builds your app/binary, and canbe runtime scope.

google-readmegoogle-flutter-data.md	REPLACE_ME	A library for Flutter developers
google-readmegoogle-flutter-data.md	REPLACE_ME	It is awesome.
google-readmegoogle-flutter-data.md	Features and bugs	Please file feature requests and bugs at the  issue tracker  tracker 
google-readmegoogle-flutter-data.md	Features and bugs	tracker : 
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Desktop Embedding for Flutter	This purpose of this project is to support buildingapplications that use  Flutter on Windows, macOS, and Linux.It consists of libraries that implement  Flutter's embeddingAPI handling drawing and mouse/keyboard input, as well asoptional plugins to access other native platform functionality.
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Setting Up	The tooling and build infrastructure for this project requires that you havea Flutter tree in the same parent directory as the clone of this project:containing flutter-desktop-embedding, containing a path to the Flutter tree touse, if you prefer not to have the Flutter tree next to
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Repository Structure	Each supported platform has a top-level directory named for the platform.Within that directory is a library directory containing the core embeddinglibrary, and an example directory containing an example application using it.See the README file in the directory corresponding to your platform for moreIn addition, there is:  plugins  See the   README  plugins/README.md  for details
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Repository Structure	 some functionality similar to the flutter tool may be added.
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Flutter Application Requirements	Because desktop platforms are not supported Flutter targets, existing Flutterapplications are likely to require slight modifications to run.
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Target Platform Override	Most applications will need to override the target platform for the applicationto one of the supported values in order to avoid 'Unknown platform' exceptions.This should be done as early as possible.In the simplest case, where the code will only run on desktop and the behaviorshould be consistent on all platforms, you can hard-code a single target:import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' ..
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Target Platform Override	void main   {  debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride = TargetPlatform.fuchsia;   ..
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Target Platform Override	If the code needs to run on both mobile and desktop, or you want differentbehavior on different desktop platforms, you can conditionalize on Platform.For example, the line in main   above could be replaced with a call to:appearance of the widgets, but also the expectations Flutter will have forwhat is available on the platform, such as fonts.
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Fonts	Flutter applications may default to fonts that are standard for the targetplatform, but unavailable on desktop
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Fonts	For instance, if the target platform isTargetPlatform.iOS the Material library will default to San Francisco, whichis available on macOS but not Linux or Windows.Most applications will need to set the font  e.g., via ThemeData  basedon the host platform, or set a specific font that is bundled with theapplication
google-readmegoogle-flutter-desktop-embedding.md	Fonts	The example application demonstrates using and bundling Robotoon all platforms.Symptoms of missing fonts can include text failing to display, console loggingabout failure to load fonts, or in some cases crashes.

google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	flutter_flux	> A Dart app architecture library with uni-directional data flow inspired by  RefluxJS  and Facebook's  Flux This is an experimental package and does not have official support from theFlutter team
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	flutter_flux	However, feedback is most welcome!
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Overview	! flux-diagram flutter_flux implements a uni-directional data flow pattern comprised of Actions, Stores, and StoreWatchers.It is based on  w_flux  but modified to use Flutter instead of React.
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Action	An Action is a command that can be dispatched  with an optional data payload  and listened to.In flutter_flux, Actions are the sole driver of application state change
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Action	Widgets and other objects dispatch Actions in response to user interaction with the rendered view
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Action	Stores listen for these Action dispatches and mutate their internal data inresponse, taking the Action payload into account as appropriate.import 'package:flutter_flux/flutter_flux.dart';// define an actionfinal Action displayString = new Action  ;// dispatch the action with a payloaddisplayString 'somePayload' ;// listen for action dispatchesdisplayString.listen _displayAlert ;_displayAlert String payload  {  print payload ;They return a Future that completes after all registered Action listeners complete
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Action	 It's NOT generally recommended touse this feature within normal app code, but it is quite useful in unit test code.
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Store	A Store is a repository and manager of app state
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Store	The base Store class provided by flutter_flux should be extended to fitthe needs of your app and its data
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Store	App state may be spread across many independent stores depending on the complexityof the app and your desired app architecture.By convention, a Store's internal data cannot be mutated directly
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Store	Instead, Store data is mutated internally inresponse to Action dispatches
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Store	Stores should otherwise be considered read-only, publicly exposing relevant data ONLYvia getter methods
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Store	 This limited data access ensures that the integrity of the uni-directional data flow is maintained.A StoreWatchers listen to Stores, typically triggering re-rendering of UI elements based on the updated Store data.import 'package:flutter_flux/flutter_flux.dart';class RandomColorStore extends Store {  String _backgroundColor = 'gray';  String get backgroundColor => _backgroundColor;  RandomColorActions _actions;  }  }// verbose syntaxactions.incrementCounter.listen _handleAction ;_handleAction payload  {  }// equivalent terse syntaxtriggerOnAction actions.incrementCounter,  payload  => counter += payload ;
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Examples	Simple examples of flutter_flux usage can be found in the example directory
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	Examples	The example  README  example/README.md includes instructions for building / running them.
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	External Consumption	flutter_flux implements a uni-directional data flow within an isolated application or code module
google-readmegoogle-flutter_flux.md	External Consumption	If flutter_flux is used as theinternal architecture of a library, this internal data flow should be considered when defining the external API.

google-readmegoogle-font-rs.md	font-rs	This is a font renderer written  mostly  in pure, safe Rust
google-readmegoogle-font-rs.md	font-rs	There is an optionalSIMD module for cumulative sum, currently written in C SSE3 intrinsics.The current state of the code is quite rough
google-readmegoogle-font-rs.md	font-rs	The code isn't well organized,and it's basically not ready for prime time
google-readmegoogle-font-rs.md	font-rs	However, it runs well enough torun benchmarks, and those benchmarks suggest extremely promising performancecompared with Freetype and freetype-go  the loose port of Freetype to Go .The rasterizer is basically very similar in design to libart  except thatvectors are drawn immediately into the buffer, rather than sorted and storedin intermediate form, and that the buffer for rasterization is a dense arrayrather than a sparse data structure
google-readmegoogle-font-rs.md	font-rs	The main motivation for the latter is toavoid branch misprediction and to better exploit data parallelism, both validtrends in optimization since libart was originally written.It's worth comparing the algorithm with that in Anti-Grain Geometry The original libart algorithm was also inspiration for the current antialiasedrenderer in Freetype
google-readmegoogle-font-rs.md	font-rs	All these renderers share many common features,particularly computation of exact subpixel areas and an integration stepto determine winding number  and convert to pixel value , but differ in detailssuch as data structures to represent the vectors and the buffer.The parsing of TrueType glyph data is done in pull-parser style, as iteratorsover the lower-level data

License  fscrypt is a high-level tool for the management of Linux filesystem encryption This tool manages metadata, key generation, key wrapping, PAM integration, andprovides a uniform interface for creating and modifying encrypted directories.For a small low-level tool that directly sets policies, see fscryptctl To use fscrypt, you must have a filesystem with encryption enabled and akernel that supports reading/writing from that filesystem
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	fscrypt  ! GitHub version  	Currently, ext4  F2FS  and UBIFS  support Linux filesystemencryption
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	fscrypt  ! GitHub version  	Ext4 has supported Linux filesystem encryption since v4.1  F2FS added support in v4.2  and UBIFS added support in v4.10  Other filesystemsmay add support for native encryption in the future
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	fscrypt  ! GitHub version  	Filesystems mayadditionally require certain kernel configuration options to be set to usenative encryption.Most of the testing for fscrypt has been done with ext4 filesystems
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	fscrypt  ! GitHub version  	However,the kernel uses a common userspace interface, so this tool should work with allexisting and future filesystems which support encryption

google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Other encryption solutions	It is important to distinguish Linux filesystem encryption from two otherencryption solutions:  eCryptfs  and dm-crypt Currently, dm-crypt encrypts an entire block device with a single master key.dm-crypt can be used with or without fscrypt
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Other encryption solutions	All filesystem data  including allfilesystem metadata  is encrypted with this single key when using dm-crypt,while fscrypt only encrypts the filenames and file contents in a specifieddirectory
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Other encryption solutions	Note that using both dm-crypt and fscrypt simultaneously will givethe protections and benefits of both; however, this may cause a decrease inyour performance, as file contents are encrypted twice.One example of a reasonable setup could involve using dm-crypt with a TPM orSecure boot key, while using fscrypt for the contents of a home directory
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Other encryption solutions	Thiswould still encrypt the entire drive, but would also tie the encryption of auser's personal documents to their passphrase.On the other hand, eCryptfs is another form of filesystem encryption on Linux;it encrypts a filesystem directory with some key or passphrase
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Other encryption solutions	eCryptfs sits ontop of an existing filesystem
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Other encryption solutions	This makes eCryptfs an alternative choice if yourfilesystem or kernel does not support native filesystem encryption.Also note that fscrypt does not support or setup either eCryptfs or dm-crypt.For these tools, use ecryptfs-utils  foreCryptfs or  cryptsetup  for dm-crypt.
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	fscrypt is intended to improve upon the work in e4crypt  by providing amore managed environment and handling more functionality in thebackground
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	fscrypt has a  design document  specifyingthe full architecture of fscrypt.Briefly, fscrypt deals with protectors and policies
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	Protectors represent somesecret or information used to protect the confidentiality of your data
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	Thethree currently supported protector types are:Your login passphrase, through  PAM A custom passphraseA raw key fileThese protectors are mutable, so the information can change without needing toupdate any of your encrypted directories.Policies represent the actual key passed to the kernel
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	This "policy key" isimmutable and policies are  usually  applied to a single directory
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	Protectorsthen protect policies, so that having one of the protectors for a policy isenough to get the policy key and access the data
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	Which protectors protect apolicy can also be changed
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Features	This allows a user to change how a directory isprotected without needing to reencrypt the directory's contents.Concretely, fscrypt contains the following functionality:information about each of the commands.
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Building and Installing	fscrypt has a minimal set of build dependencies:Once all the dependencies are installed, you can get the repository by running:Running make in $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/fscrypt builds theexecutable  fscrypt  and PAM module  pam-fscrypt.so  in the bin/directory
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Building and Installing	Use make bin/fscrypt or make bin/pam_fscrypt.soto build only one.Running pam-fscrypt to /lib/security
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Building and Installing	Use make install-bin or make install-pamto install only one.See the Makefile for instructions on how to customize the build  e.g
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Building and Installing	installingto a custom location, using different build flags, building a static binary,etc ..
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Building and Installing	Alternatively, if you only want to install the fscrypt binary to 
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Runtime Dependencies	fscrypt has very few runtime dependencies:
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Setting up the PAM module	Note that to make use of the installed PAM module, your PAM configuration files in /etc/pam.d must be modified to add fscrypt.
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Automatic setup on Ubuntu	fscrypt automatically installs the PAM config file pam_fscrypt/config to /usr/share/pam-configs/fscrypt
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Automatic setup on Ubuntu	This file containsreasonable defaults for the PAM module
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Automatic setup on Ubuntu	To automatically apply these changes,run sudo pam-auth-update and follow the on-screen instructions.
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Manual setup	The fscrypt PAM module implements the Auth, Session, and Password types The Password functionality of after pam_unix.so in /etc/pam.d/common-password or similar.The Auth and Session functionality of lock_policies option locks the directories protected with the user's loginpassphrase when the last session ends
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Manual setup	The drop_caches option tells fscrypt toclear the filesystem caches when the last session closes, ensuring all thelocked data is inaccessible
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Manual setup	All the types also support the debug option whichprints additional debug information to the syslog.
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Note about stability	fscrypt follows  semantic versioning  As such, all versionsbelow 1.0.0 should be considered development versions
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Note about stability	This means noguarantees are make about the stability of APIs or formats of config files
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Note about stability	Asthe on-disk metadata structures use Protocol Buffers  we don't expect to breakbackwards compatibility for metadata, but we give no guarantees.
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Example Usage	All these examples assume we have ext4 filesystems mounted at /mnt/disk which both support encryption and that /mnt/disk containsdirectories we want to encrypt.

google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Protecting a directory with your login passphrase	As noted above and in the troubleshooting below, fscrypt cannot  yet  detectwhen your login passphrase changes
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Protecting a directory with your login passphrase	So if you protect a directory with yourlogin passphrase, you may have to do additional work when you change your system
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Login passphrases also require that fscrypt is setup on the root directory	>>>>> sudo fscrypt setup /Filesystem "/"  /dev/dm-1  ready for use with ext4 encryption.

google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Using a raw key protector	fscrypt also supports protectors which use raw key files as the user-providedsecret
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Using a raw key protector	These key files must be exactly 32 bytes long and contain the raw binarydata of the key
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Using a raw key protector	Obviously, make sure to store the key file securely  and not inthe directory you are encrypting with it

google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Using multiple protectors for a policy	fscrypt supports the idea of of protecting a single directory with multipleprotectors
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Using multiple protectors for a policy	This means having access to any of the protectors is sufficient todecrypt the directory
google-readmegoogle-fscrypt.md	Using multiple protectors for a policy	This is useful for sharing data or setting up accesscontrol systems.

google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Finally build functionsimsearch tools	cd ..make -j8This should build the relevant executables to try
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Finally build functionsimsearch tools	On Debian stretch and later,you may have to add '-fPIC' into the pe-parse CMakeLists.txt to make sure yourgenerated library supports being relocated.
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Running the tests	You can run the tests by doing:will not work.Also be aware that a fair number of the tests are pretty expensive to run, andexpect the full testsuite to eat all your CPU for a few minutes; the suite ofslow tests may keep your computer busy for hours.
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Running the tools	At the moment, the following executables will be built  in alphabetical order :

google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Add ELFs with interesting functions to the search index.	At this point, we can start scanning a given new executable for any of thefunctions in the search index.bin/matchfunctionsfromindex -format=PE -index=./trained.index -input=../bin/libpng-1.6.26_msvc14/libpng16.dll -weights=./trained_weights_500.txtsr/local/google/home/thomasdullien/Desktop/sources/functionsimsearch/trained_weights_500.txt  !

google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Add ELFs with interesting functions to the search index.	While this is nice and fine, all we get is the source executable ID and theaddress of the function we matched to
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Add ELFs with interesting functions to the search index.	In order to make sense of this, we needto make sure there is a file called "./trained.index.metadata" in the samedirectory as the index file.This file should contain simple space-delimited lines of the format:The last field indicates whether the function is known to be vulnerable or not.Re-running our matching command above now yields much more useful output:
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	End-to-end tutorial: Training weights prior to building an index of vulnerable functions	How does one train weights prior to building a search index? We need a coupleof ingredients:  predictive value.In order to generate labelled datasets, the usual process involves compiling thesame codebase with many different compilers and compiler settings
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	End-to-end tutorial: Training weights prior to building an index of vulnerable functions	In an idealworld, we would have something like Compiler Explorer; in the meantime, peoplewill have to build things themselves.
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Generating input data	Input data currently consists of three text files:Generating these files from the unrar executables is somewhat involved -to extract the function names from debug information, convert between differentcompiler conventions on how to demangle their names, and finally match the oneswe can match by identical name
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Generating input data	For the moment, simply use the below shell script;run it from ./bin after having built everything.Generate bashcd ./testdatachmod +x ./generate_test_data.shThe script creates two directories: /tmp/train/validation_data
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Generating input data	Both directories will contain the files describedabove, all of them generated from the unrar executables
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Generating input data	The set of functionsappearing in the training data should be disjoint from the set of functionsappearing in the validation data.Note that the shell script is grossly inefficient
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Generating input data	Rewriting this hack in C++would be a great thing for a contributor to do :- .
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Running the training code	In order to launch the training itself, simply do:bin/trainsimhashweights -data=/tmp/train/training_data/ -train_steps=500 -weights=./trained_weights_500.txtThis should launch the training process and nicely max out all the cores you havein your machine
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Running the training code	Unfortunately, there is no GPU-accelerated training yet, so oddsare you will have to wait a few hours until the training is done.The resulting weights will be written to the specified output file.
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Running the validation code	After we have arun a training iteration, we need to check whether the trainingactually did anything useful
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Running the validation code	Run the following command line to see what theeffects of the new weights are on the validation set:bin/evalsimhashweights -data=/tmp/train/training_data/ -weights=./trained_weights_500.txtRunning this command will output data for 4 histograms  ideally visualized usingGNUplot , and the differences between the mean distances preAttraction mean trained: 1.6483634587e+01Attraction mean untrained: 2.3003175379e+01Repulsion mean trained: 3.1962383977e+01Repulsion mean untrained: 2.8451636541e+01As we can see here, the average distance between two identical pairs was loweredto 16.5 bits from 23.0 bits, and the average distance for non-identical pairswas increased to 32 bits from 28.5 bits prior to training.Drawing histograms from the data can be done as follows  assuming you have pipedthe output to /tmp/evaldata :cat /tmp/evaldata | grep -v  a-z  > /tmp/evalgnuplot> set multiplot layout 2, 1 title "Premultiplot> plot '/tmp/eval' index 1 with lines title "Repulsion pre-train", '/tmp/eval' index 3 with lines title "Repulsion post-train"multiplot> plot '/tmp/eval' index 0 with lines title "Attraction pre-train", '/tmp/eval' index 2 with lines title "Attraction post-train"multiplot> unset multiplot
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Compiling the same debian package with many compilers/settings	For all experiments with this codebase, it is often useful to be able to compilea given codebase with a number of different compilers and compiler settings
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Compiling the same debian package with many compilers/settings	Thisis often complicated, though, by various Makefiles and build scripts ignoringflags provided to them by debuild, or alternatively, by clang ignoring all butthe last -Ox argument
google-readmegoogle-functionsimsearch.md	Compiling the same debian package with many compilers/settings	The following is a quick guide on how to rebuild a givenDebian package with a number of different compiler settings.following command:directory=$ pwd|rev|cut -d"/" -f1|rev ; for config in $ ls ~/.config/gcc-wrapper/ ; do config=$ echo $config|rev|cut -d"/" -f1|rev ; DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nostrip" debuild --set-envvar=GCC_PROFIL=$config -b -us -uc -j36; cd ..; mkdir $ echo $directory .$config; mv ./*.deb $ echo $directory .$config; cd $directory; doneThis should take every compiler configuration that you have in your gcc-wrapperdirectory, and rebuild the package with this compiler configuration

google-readmegoogle-gemmlowp.md	Architecture-specific optimized code paths	The compiled binary shouldwork on all Intel CPUs since 2008  including low power microarchitectures  aswell as AMD CPUs since Please note when compiling binaries that don't need to be distributed, it'sgenerally a better idea to pass -march=native to the compiler
google-readmegoogle-gemmlowp.md	Architecture-specific optimized code paths	That flagimplies -msse4.1 flag, along with others that might be helpful
google-readmegoogle-gemmlowp.md	Architecture-specific optimized code paths	This of courseassumes the host machine supports those instructions

google-readmegoogle-gemmlowp.md	Building by manually invoking your compiler	Because gemmlowp is so simple, working with it involves only single-command-linecompiler invocations
google-readmegoogle-gemmlowp.md	Building by manually invoking your compiler	Therefore we expect that most people working with gemmlowpwill either manually invoke their compiler, or write their own rules for theirown preferred build system.Keep in mind  previous section  that gemmlowp itself is a pure-headers-onlylibrary so there is nothing to build.For a Android gemmlowp development workflow, the scripts/ directory contains ascript to build and run a program on an Android device:That being said, we also maintain a Bazel BUILD system as part of gemmlowp

google-readmegoogle-gfw-toolkit.md	Deprecation Notice	Users of gfw-toolkit,The team at Google responsible for gfw-toolkit want to provide you with a 30 day notice that the repository  google/gfw-toolkit  will be deprecated on 11/14/
google-readmegoogle-gfw-toolkit.md	What does this mean?	The github project will be deprecated and Google will discontinue support for gfw-toolkit.
google-readmegoogle-gfw-toolkit.md	Why are you doing this?	The reason Google first created these tools was to address a need when there were limited alternatives in the market
google-readmegoogle-gfw-toolkit.md	Why are you doing this?	Today there are options available that are better supported and in many cases provide an improved experience.
google-readmegoogle-gfw-toolkit.md	What are the alternative options?	We recommend switching to use  Google Apps Manager  as the functionality provided by gfw-toolkit is well supported by Google Apps Manager and can offer an improved benefit over it.Here's an  example on key management with GAM We thank you for your support and use of the tool, we hope it was useful!

google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Gin	Gin provides a lightweight configuration framework for Python, based ondependency injection
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Gin	Functions or classes can be decorated with@gin.configurable, allowing default parameter values to be supplied from aconfig file  or passed via the command line  using a simple but powerful syntax.This removes the need to define and maintain configuration objects  e.g.protos , or write boilerplate parameter plumbing and factory code, while oftendramatically expanding a project's flexibility and configurability.Gin is particularly well suited for machine learning experiments  e.g
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Gin	usingTensorFlow , which tend to have many parameters, often nested in complex ways.**Authors**: Dan Holtmann-Rice, Sergio Guadarrama, Nathan SilbermanThis is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Table of Contents	 TOC 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Basic usage	This section provides a high-level overview of Gin's main features, orderedroughly from "basic" to "advanced"
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Basic usage	More details on these and other features canbe found in the  user guide 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Basic usage	user guide : 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Setup	Install Gin with pip:At its most basic, Gin can be seen as a way of providing or changing defaultvalues for function or constructor parameters
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Setup	To make a function's parameters"configurable", Gin provides the gin.configurable decorator:values are supported as value  numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dicts 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Setup	Oncethe config file has been parsed by Gin  gin.parse_config_file , any futurecalls to dnn will use the Gin-specified value for layer_sizes  unless avalue is explicitly provided by the caller .Classes can also be marked as configurable, in which case the configurationapplies to constructor parameters:@gin.configurableclass DNN object :  # Constructor parameters become configurable
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Setup	 def __init__ self,Within a config file, the class name is used when binding values to constructorgin.configurable decorator and a call to one of Gin's parsing functions.
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	In addition to accepting Python literal values, Gin also supports passing otherGin-configurable functions or classes
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	In the example above, we might want tochange the activation_fn parameter
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	If we have registered, say tf.nn.tanhwith Gin  see  registering external functions  external configurables  , we canpass it to activation_fn by referring to it as @tanh  or @tf.nn.tanh :references work for classes as well:class constructor
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	Gin supports "evaluating" configurable references via the@name   syntax
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	For example, say we wanted to use the class form of DNN fromabove  which implements __call__ to "behave" like a function  in the followingPython code:parameters must be provided via Gin
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	The call to the function or constructortakes place *just beforepassed, In the above example, this would be just before build_model is called.The result is not cached, so a new DNN instance will be constructed for eachcall to build_model
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Passing functions, classes, and instances  "configurable references" 	external configurables : 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Configuring the same function in different ways  "scopes" 	What happens if we want to configure the same function in different ways? Forinstance, imagine we're building a GAN, where we might have a "generator"network and a "discriminator" network
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Configuring the same function in different ways  "scopes" 	We'd like to use the dnn function aboveto construct both, but with different parameters:set of bindings for a given function or class
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Configuring the same function in different ways  "scopes" 	In both bindings and references,the "scope name" precedes the function name, separated by a "scope_name/function_name :
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Inside "config.gin"	run_training.train_input_fn = @train/input_fnrun_training.eval_input_fn = @eval/input_fninput_fn.batch_size = 64  # Shared by both train and eval...train/input_fn.file_pattern = ...eval/input_fn.file_pattern = ...run_training.estimator = @tf.estimator.Estimator  tf.estimator.Estimator.model_fn = @build_model_fn  build_model_fn.network_fn = @dnndnn.layer_sizes =  1024, 512, 256 build_model_fn.loss_fn = @tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropybuild_model_fn.optimize_loss_fn = @optimize_lossoptimize_loss.optimizer_cls = @tf.train.MomentumOptimizerMomentumOptimizer.momentum = 0.9optimize_loss.learning_rate = 0.01Note that it is straightforward to switch between different network functions,optimizers, datasets, loss functions, etc
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Inside "config.gin"	via different config files.
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Full hierarchical configuration	The greatest degree of flexibility and configurability in a project is achievedby writing small modular functions and "wiring them up" hierarchically via possibly scoped  references
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Full hierarchical configuration	For example, this code sketches a generic trainingsetup that could be used with the tf.estimator.Estimator API:@gin.configurabledef build_model_fn network_fn, loss_fn, optimize_loss_fn :  def model_fn features, labels :  return model_fndef optimize_loss loss, optimizer_cls, learning_rate :  optimizer = optimizer_cls learning_rate   return optimizer.minimize loss def input_fn file_pattern, batch_size, ..
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Full hierarchical configuration	:  ...def run_training train_input_fn, eval_input_fn, estimator, steps=1000 :  estimator.train train_input_fn, steps=steps   estimator.evaluate eval_input_fn   ...In conjunction with suitable  external configurables  to register TensorFlowfunctions/classes  e.g., Estimator and various optimizers , this could beconfigured as follows:
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Additional features	Additional features described in more detail in the  user guide  include: macros :  imports :  includes :  TensorBoard integration :  modules : 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Best practices	At a high level, we recommend using the minimal feature set required to achieveyour project's desired degree of configurability
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Best practices	Many projects may onlyrequire the features outlined in sections 2 or 3 above
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Best practices	Extreme configurabilitycomes at some cost to understandability, and the tradeoff should be carefullyevaluated for a given project.Gin is still in alpha development and some corner-case behaviors may bechanged in backwards-incompatible ways
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Best practices	We recommend the following bestIn short, use Gin responsibly : 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Syntax quick reference	A quick reference for syntax unique to Gin  which otherwise supportsnon-control-flow Python syntax, including literal values and linecontinuations 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Syntax quick reference	Note that where function and class names are used, these mayinclude a dotted module name prefix  some.module.function_name 
google-readmegoogle-gin-config.md	Syntax quick reference

google-readmegoogle-git-appraise-web.md	Prerequisites	Building requires the Go tools and GNU Make
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise-web.md	Prerequisites	Running the built binary requires the git command line tool.
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise-web.md	Building the source code	Assuming you have the  Go tools installed  runthe following command:
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise-web.md	Manual steps	Assuming you have not run the above command, first checkout the code from the git repo:Build the binary:
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise-web.md	Running the application	Binary is placed into ${GOPATH}/bin:The tool requires that it be started in a directory that contains at least one git repo, and it shows thereviews from every git repo under that directory.The UI is a webserver which defaults to listening on port To use a different port, pass it as an argument to the "--port" flag:
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Distributed Code Review For Git	  This repo contains a command line tool for performing code reviews on git
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Overview	This tool is a *distributedBy "distributed", we mean that code reviews are stored inside of the repositoryas git objects
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Overview	Every developer on your team has their own copy of the reviewhistory that they can push or pull
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Overview	When pulling, updates from the remoterepo are automatically merged by the tool.This design removes the need for any sort of server-side setup
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Overview	As a result,this tool can work with any git hosting provider, and the only setup requiredis installing the client on your workstation.
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Installation	Assuming you have the  Go tools installed  runthe following command:Then, either make sure that ${GOPATH}/bin is in your PATH, or explicitly add the"appraise" git alias by running the following command.
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Requirements	This tool expects to run in an environment with the following attributes: The git command line tool is installed, and included in the PATH
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Requirements	The tool is run from within a git repo
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Requirements	The git command line tool is configured with the credentials it needs to
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Usage	Requesting a code review:Pushing code reviews to a remote:Pulling code reviews from a remote:Listing open code reviews:Showing the status of the current review, including comments:Showing the diff of a review:Commenting on a review:Accepting the changes in a review:Submitting the current review:A more detailed getting started doc is available  here  docs/tutorial.md .
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Metadata	The code review data is stored in  git-notes using the formats described below
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Metadata	Each item stored is written as a singleline of JSON, and is written with at most one such item per line
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Metadata	This allowsthe git notes to be automatically merged using the "cat\_sort\_uniq" strategy.Since these notes are not in a human-friendly form, all of the refs used totrack them start with the prefix "refs/notes/devtools"
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Metadata	This helps make itclear that these are meant to be read and written by automated tools.When a field named "v" appears in one of these notes, it is used to denotethe version of the metadata format being used
google-readmegoogle-git-appraise.md	Metadata	If that field is missing, thenit defaults to the value 0, which corresponds to this initial version of the

google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Git Presubmit Linter	Git Presubmit Linter is a project which contains a variety of QOL toolsto help developers maintain high-quality, consistent commits intheir projects.The project contains a collection of shell scripts which can beconfigured and run during a pre-submit task
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Git Presubmit Linter	The scripts will reportpotential issues found in the commit.This is not an officially supported Google product.
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Get Started	You can easily include this project into your CI system whenit runs:There are many rules that are available in the rules/ directory.Each can be accessed in a shell script by piping a string into thescript and providing additional parameters.Each rule will either complete without issue or return an errorcode
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Get Started	In a presubmit script, you can set errors to exit thescript early.set -e
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Verb Tense	This rule is used to verify that a commit message is written in agiven verb tense, such as present tense or past tense.git log -1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/verb-tense.sh If the commit message starts with a present tense verb, like:"**Adds new field**"The script succeeds
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Verb Tense	However, if it is in a different tense like below,the script will exit early with a non-zero status."**I have added a new field**"This supports present, imperative, and past tense verbs.
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	No Second Line	This rule verifies that the second line in a commit message isempty, a common style in git.git log -1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/no-second-line.shThe script succeeds if the second line of the commit message isempty, and it fails otherwise with a non-zero status.
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Line Length	This rule verifies that every line in a commit message or in thecode diff is under a certain line length
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Line Length	Style guides oftenwant code to be a maximum length per line, and git commitmessages are typically short as well.It can be used by passing a string and including the maximumgit diff HEAD~1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/line-length.sh **Note**: Git diffs will add in additional spacing to each line.To verify the line length, you will need to add 2 to your maximum,eg
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Line Length	A style guide with 80 characters max per line should use 82.
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	First Line Length	Sometimes you may only want to check the length of the first line ofa message only, or may want a different maximum
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	First Line Length	This can be implementedby piping your commit message into the rule using head.git log -1 --pretty=%B | head -n1 | ./rules/line-length.sh 
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Contains String	This rule verifies that a certain string appears in a commit message.Style guides may require developers to include a description of a test,or an issue number.It can be used by including the string you want to identify
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Contains String	This scriptwill pass if the string is exactly matched anywhere on any line of thegit log -1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/has-string.sh To require contributors to mention tests, you can use:git log -1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/has-string.sh "Test:"
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Searching for edited files	If you want to check whether a certain file has been modified such as aCHANGELOG file, you can instead run:git diff HEAD~1 --name-only | ./rules/has-string.sh "CHANGELOG"
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Contains Pattern	Sometimes simple string matching is not enough
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Contains Pattern	This rule will checkevery line for the instance of a regular expression.git log -1 --pretty=%B | head -n1 | ./rules/has-pattern.sh If a style guide requires commit messages to start with a capitalletter, you can use:git log -1 --pretty=%B | head -n1 | ./rules/has-pattern.sh "^ A-Z "
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Does not contain string	Style guides may ban the use of certain notes that developers put intocode such as "TODO", "FIXME", "NOTE", etc
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Does not contain string	This rule will check each lineand exit with a non-zero status if a given string is found.git log -1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/block-string.sh 
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Trailing Whitespace	This rule verifies that no changed line has any trailing whitespace.Style guides may require this to be removed.git diff HEAD~1 --pretty=%B | ./rules/trailing-whitespace.sh
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Tools	This repo also contains tools to be run during a presubmit task
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Tools	These donot verify the git metadata or other project details, but can produceuseful artifacts that may be part of the presubmit process.
google-readmegoogle-git-presubmit-linter.md	Changelog	This tool will generate a changelog between two points in your git history ina Markdown format, with the summary of each commit prepended by an asterisk../tools/changelog.sh v1.0.0 v1.0.1

google-readmegoogle-git-pull-request-mirror.md	Mirror Github Pull Requests into the git-appraise formats	This repo contains a tool to mirror pull requests metadata into the corresponding gitrepository using a feature of git called  git-notes The format written is the one defined by the git-appraise code review system  so pullrequests that are mirrored using this tool can be reviewed using git-appraise.
google-readmegoogle-git-pull-request-mirror.md	Organization	There are 3 packages in this repo:
google-readmegoogle-git-pull-request-mirror.md	The Batch Tool	The batch tool performs a single pass of reading all of the pull request metadata fora repo, and mirroring it into your local clone of that repo.The tool can support running unauthenticated, but will be extremely rate-limited, soit is better if you create a  personal access token with the repo scope, for it to use.This app allows users to continually update their git repositories with githubmetadata  pull requests and build statuses 
google-readmegoogle-git-pull-request-mirror.md	The Batch Tool	It runs in a managed VM in anon-default module, and should expose a web interface atIt uses the app engine datastore to store its configuration.To deploy:
google-readmegoogle-git-sync-changes.md	Collaborative editing for git repositories	This repository implements shared worktrees for git.This is done by storing the worktree state in the repository itself.The result is that anyone with push permissions on the repositorycan sync their local worktree with that shared worktree, and thenview and edit pending changes prior to committing them.
google-readmegoogle-git-sync-changes.md	Disclaimer	This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-git-sync-changes.md	Installation	To install, simply copy the git-sync-changes script to somewherein your PATH.
google-readmegoogle-git-sync-changes.md	Usage	The shared worktree functionality is implemented with a new gitcommand called git-sync-changes
google-readmegoogle-git-sync-changes.md	Usage	Running that command will syncpending changes between your local worktree and the shared worktree,leaving the two in the same state.The command takes two optional parameters, the remote repositorystoring the shared worktree, and the name of that tree.For example:in the remote named origin.If the worktree name is not specified, the tool will default toa worktree named after the current user and the current checked-outIf the remote is not specified, then it defaults to origin.Each invocation of the command only performs a single sync, so tokeep your worktree continuously updated, run it periodically.For instance, you could run the command in a loop with something
google-readmegoogle-github-issue-mover.md	Issue Mover for GitHub	This tool make it easy to migrate issues between repos: both client side and server side code  and is hosted on  Google App Engine Managed VM For a walk through of the code and backend deployment options please read  CODE_WALKTHROUGH  CODE_WALKTHROUGH.md 
google-readmegoogle-github-issue-mover.md	Usage	The tool is hosted online at  github-issue-mover.appspot.com It looks like this:
google-readmegoogle-github-issue-mover.md	How to use	You can copy paste full GitHub URLs
google-readmegoogle-github-issue-mover.md	How to use	For instance you can copy pasteinto the "Issue to Move" text field
google-readmegoogle-github-issue-mover.md	How to use	It will get automatically transformed to the _short_ GitHub URL:The tool will extract some information about the issue if it's accessible to your user:You can do the same for the "Destination Repo" text field and copy paste:It will get automatically transformed to the _short_ GitHub URL for repos:and some information will get extracted as well:Once existing issue and repo have been set you can start the move process:This will create a new issue which is a copy of the original one, with mentions of every users who commented on the bug
google-readmegoogle-github-issue-mover.md	How to use	The two issues will also references themselves:

google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	gitprotocolio	A Git protocol parser written in Go.This is more like an experimental project to better understand the protocol.This is not an official Google product  i.e
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	gitprotocolio	a 20% project .
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	Git protocol is defined in Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt This is not a complete definition
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	Also, a transport specific spec Documentation/technical/http-protocol.txt is not complete
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	This project was started so that these upstream protocol specbecomes more accurate
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	To verify the written syntax is accurate, this projectincludes a Git protocol parser written in Go, and have end-to-end test suites.This makes it easy to write a test case for Git client
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	Currently the test casesare run against the canonical Git implementation, but this can be extended torun against JGit, etc.
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	Also it makes it easy to test an attack case
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	With thislibrary, one can write an attack case like git-bomb  against Git protocol by producinga request that is usually not produced by a sane Git client
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	Protocol propertiescan also be checked
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	For example, it's possible to write a test to check validrequest/response's prefixes are not a valid request/response
google-readmegoogle-gitprotocolio.md	Background	This propertymakes sure a client won't process an incomplete response thinking it's complete.

google-readmegoogle-go-containerregistry.md	Introduction	This is a golang library for working with container registries
google-readmegoogle-go-containerregistry.md	Introduction	It's largely based on the  Python library of the same name  but more hip and uses GitHub as the source of truth.
google-readmegoogle-go-containerregistry.md	Tools	This repo hosts three tools built on top of the library.
google-readmegoogle-go-containerregistry.md	ko	 ko  cmd/ko/README.md  is a tool for building and deploying golang applications to kubernetes.
google-readmegoogle-go-containerregistry.md	crane	 crane  cmd/crane/doc/crane.md  is a tool for interacting with remote images and registries.
google-readmegoogle-go-containerregistry.md	gcrane	 gcrane  cmd/gcrane/README.md  is a variant of crane that has richer output forthe ls subcommand and some basic garbage collection support.
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	go-github #	    ! Test Coverage    ! Discuss at go-github@googlegroups.com  go-github is a Go client library for accessing the  GitHub API v3   .go-github requires Go version 1.8 or greater.If you're interested in using the  GraphQL API v4   , the recommended library is shurcooL/githubv4   .
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Usage ##	access different parts of the GitHub API
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Usage ##	For example:client := github.NewClient nil // list all organizations for user "willnorris"orgs, _, err := client.Organizations.List context.Background  , "willnorris", nil Some API methods have optional parameters that can be passed
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Usage ##	For example:client := github.NewClient nil // list public repositories for org "github"opt := &github.RepositoryListByOrgOptions{Type: "public"}repos, _, err := client.Repositories.ListByOrg context.Background  , "github", opt The services of a client divide the API into logical chunks and correspond tothe structure of the GitHub API documentation atNOTE: Using the  context  package, one can easilypass cancelation signals and deadlines to various services of the client forhandling a request
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Usage ##	In case there is no context available, then context.Background  can be used as a starting point.For more sample code snippets, head over to the example  directory.
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Authentication ###	The go-github library does not directly handle authentication
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Authentication ###	Instead, whencreating a new client, pass an http.Client
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Authentication ###	If you have an OAuth2 access token  for example, a  personalAPI token    , you can use it with the oauth2 library using:import "golang.org/x/oauth2"func main   {	ctx := context.Background  	ts := oauth2.StaticTokenSource 		&oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "..
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Authentication ###	your access token ..."},	 	tc := oauth2.NewClient ctx, ts 	client := github.NewClient tc 	// list all repositories for the authenticated user	repos, _, err := client.Repositories.List ctx, "", nil Note that when using an authenticated Client, all calls made by the client willinclude the specified OAuth token
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Authentication ###	Therefore, authenticated clients shouldalmost never be shared between different users.See the  oauth2 docs    for complete instructions on using that library.For API methods that require HTTP Basic Authentication, use the BasicAuthTransport GitHub Apps authentication can be provided by the  ghinstallation import "github.com/bradleyfalzon/ghinstallation"func main   {	// Wrap the shared transport for use with the integration ID 1 authenticating with installation ID 	itr, err := ghinstallation.NewKeyFromFile http.DefaultTransport, 1, 99, "2016-10-19.private-key.pem" 	if err != nil {		// Handle error.	}	// Use installation transport with client.	client := github.NewClient &http.Client{Transport: itr} 	// Use client...
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Rate Limiting ###	GitHub imposes a rate limit on all API clients
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Rate Limiting ###	Unauthenticated clients arelimited to 60 requests per hour, while authenticated clients can make up to5,000 requests per hour
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Rate Limiting ###	The Search API has a custom rate limit
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Rate Limiting ###	Unauthenticatedclients are limited to 10 requests per minute, while authenticated clientscan make up to 30 requests per minute
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Rate Limiting ###	To receive the higher rate limit whenmaking calls that are not issued on behalf of a user,use UnauthenticatedRateLimitedTransport.The returned Response.Rate value contains the rate limit informationfrom the most recent API call
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Rate Limiting ###	If a recent enough response isn'tavailable, you can use RateLimits to fetch the most up-to-date ratelimit data for the client.To detect an API rate limit error, you can check if its type is *github.RateLimitError:
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Accepted Status ###	Some endpoints may return a 202 Accepted status code, meaning that theinformation required is not yet ready and was scheduled to be gathered onthe GitHub side
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Accepted Status ###	Methods known to behave like this are documented specifyingthis behavior.To detect this condition of error, you can check if its type isThe GitHub API has good support for conditional requests which will helpprevent you from burning through your rate limit, as well as help speed up yourapplication
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Accepted Status ###	go-github does not handle conditional requests directly, but isinstead designed to work with a caching http.Transport
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Accepted Status ###	We recommend using for that.Learn more about GitHub conditional requests at
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Creating and Updating Resources ###	All structs for GitHub resources use pointer values for all non-repeated fields.This allows distinguishing between unset fields and those set to a zero-value.Helper functions have been provided to easily create these pointers for string,bool, and int values
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Creating and Updating Resources ###	For example:
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Pagination ###	All requests for resource collections  repos, pull requests, issues, etc
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Pagination ###	support pagination
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Pagination ###	Pagination options are described in thegithub.Response struct.client := github.NewClient nil opt := &github.RepositoryListByOrgOptions{	ListOptions: github.ListOptions{PerPage: 10},// get all pages of resultsvar allRepos   *github.Repositoryfor {	repos, resp, err := client.Repositories.ListByOrg ctx, "github", opt 	if err != nil {		return err	}	allRepos = append allRepos, repos..
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Pagination ###		if resp.NextPage == 0 {		break	}	opt.Page = resp.NextPageFor complete usage of go-github, see the full  package docs   
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Pagination ###	GitHub API v3 :  oauth2 :  oauth2 docs :  personal API token :  package docs :  GraphQL API v4 :  shurcooL/githubv4 : 
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Integration Tests ###	You can run integration tests from the test directory
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Integration Tests ###	See the integration tests  README  test/README.md .
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Roadmap ##	This library is being initially developed for an internal application atGoogle, so API methods will likely be implemented in the order that they areneeded by that application
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Roadmap ##	You can track the status of implementation in this Google spreadsheet  roadmap 
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Roadmap ##	 roadmap : 
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Contributing ##	I would like to cover the entire GitHub API and contributions are of course always welcome
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Contributing ##	Thecalling pattern is pretty well established, so adding new methods is relativelystraightforward
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Contributing ##	See  CONTRIBUTING.md  CONTRIBUTING.md  for details.
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Versioning ##	In general, go-github follows  semver  as closely as wecan for tagging releases of the package
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Versioning ##	For self-contained libraries, theapplication of semantic versioning is relatively straightforward and generallyunderstood
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Versioning ##	But because go-github is a client library for the GitHub API, whichitself changes behavior, and because we are typically pretty aggressive aboutimplementing preview features of the GitHub API, we've adopted the followingversioning policy:	or behavior of the API.	functionality, as well as any changes to preview functionality in the GitHub	API
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Versioning ##	GitHub makes no guarantee about the stability of preview functionality,	so neither do we consider it a stable part of the go-github API.Preview functionality may take the form of entire methods or simply additionaldata returned from an otherwise non-preview method
google-readmegoogle-go-github.md	Versioning ##	Refer to the GitHub APIdocumentation for details on preview functionality.

google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Installation	To install this package, clone it under your $GOPATH/src/ directory.
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	Package trace allows debugging programs via trace statements insertedin code
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	Sometimes you need to see the sequence in which functions arecalled, and stepping through each manually with a debugger is not theappropriate answer
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	If you've ever sprinkled "Printf" statementsthroughout your code to get insight into what's happenning, thispackage is strictly better: in addition to printing the messages youspecify, it denotes the structure of the stack by appropriatelyindenting them  and indenting the names of the callers , and printingtime stamps of when the trace calls occurred.Tracing is as simple as inserting a Trace statements where you want todo the tracing
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	These statements will print all the currrent stackframes to the most recent previously traced stack frame that is on thecurrent stack.You may also pass printf-style arguments to Trace to displayinteresting state of your program:You should turn on tracing before the point in your program where youwant to trace
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	If you want to trace a package init   function, turn iton there
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	This function call is idempotent
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	It is merely a shorthandfor setting Global.On:You may also turn off tracing at any point you wish:In fact, you may change many of the seetings of an active Tracerobject by modifying them directly
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	For example, to make global traceronly trace the last reported goroutine, useWhile in most cases you'll want to use the trace.Global logger accessible directly and through the trace.Trace function , you canalso create custom Tracer objects and use them via Tracer.Trace  .Tracer is concurrency-safe
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	When Trace   is called from a differentgoroutine than its previous call, it prints a warning about agoroutine switch
google-readmegoogle-go-trace.md	Usage	Optionally, it can print just the current goroutinestack frame including frames recorded earlier  ifOnGoroutineSwitchPrintCurrentStack is set; default is false inGlobal , or print the entire history of the stack for this goroutine if OnGoroutineSwitchPrintStackHistory is set; default is true inGlobal .This is not an officially supported Google product.

google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	Options	All Spawn functions accept a variadic of type expect.Option , these are used for changingoptions of the Expecter.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	CheckDuration	The Go Expecter checks for new data every two seconds as default
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	CheckDuration	This can be changed by usingthe CheckDuration func CheckDuration d time.Duration  Option.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	Verbose	The Verbose option is used to turn on/off verbose logging for Expect/Send statements.This option can be very useful when troubleshooting workflows since it will log every interactionwith the device.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	VerboseWriter	The VerboseWriter option can be used to change where the verbose session logs are written.Using this option will start writing verbose output to the provided io.Writer instead of the log default.See the  ExampleVerbose  code for an example of how to use this
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	NoCheck	The Go Expecter periodically checks that the spawned process/ssh/session/telnet etc
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	NoCheck	session is alive.This option turns that check off.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	DebugCheck	The DebugCheck option adds debugging to the alive Check done by the Expecter, this will start logging informationeverytime the check is run
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	DebugCheck	Can be used for troubleshooting and debugging of Spawners.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	ChangeCheck	The ChangeCheck option makes it possible to replace the Spawner Check function with a brand new one.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	networkbit.ch	An  article  with some examples was written about goexpect on  networkbit.ch  
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	Telnet	First we try to replicate the Telnet example from wikipedia as close as possible.+ username:+ password:+ %+ %*Error checking was omitted to keep the example short*package mainimport  	"flag"	"fmt"	"log"	"regexp"	"time"	"github.com/google/goexpect"	"github.com/google/goterm/term" const  	timeout = 10  var  	addr = flag.String "address", "", "address of telnet server" 	user = flag.String "user", "", "username to use" 	pass = flag.String "pass", "", "password to use" 	cmd  = flag.String "cmd", "", "command to run" 	userRE   = regexp.MustCompile "username:" 	passRE   = regexp.MustCompile "password:" 	promptRE = regexp.MustCompile "%"  func main   {	flag.Parse  	fmt.Println term.Bluef "Telnet 1 example"  	e, _, err := expect.Spawn fmt.Sprintf "telnet %s", *addr , -1 	if err != nil {		log.Fatal err 	}	defer e.Close  	e.Expect userRE, timeout 	e.Send *user + "\n" 	e.Expect passRE, timeout 	e.Send *pass + "\n" 	e.Expect promptRE, timeout 	e.Send *cmd + "\n" 	result, _, _ := e.Expect promptRE, timeout 	e.Send "exit\n" 	fmt.Println term.Greenf "%s: result: %s\n", *cmd, result  In essence to run and attach to a process the expect.Spawn ,  is used.The spawn returns and Expecter that can rund e.Expect and e.Send commands to match informationin the output and Send information in.*See the   example for a slightly more fleshed out version*
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	FTP	For the FTP example we use the expect.Batch for the following interaction.+ username:+ password:+ ftp>+ ftp>+ ftp>'package mainimport  	"flag"	"fmt"	"log"	"time"	"github.com/google/goexpect"	"github.com/google/goterm/term" const  	timeout = 10  var  	addr = flag.String "address", "", "address of telnet server" 	user = flag.String "user", "", "username to use" 	pass = flag.String "pass", "", "password to use"  func main   {	flag.Parse  	fmt.Println term.Bluef "Ftp 1 example"  	e, _, err := expect.Spawn fmt.Sprintf "ftp %s", *addr , -1 	if err != nil {		log.Fatal err 	}	defer e.Close  	e.ExpectBatch   expect.Batcher{		&expect.BExp{R: "username:"},		&expect.BSnd{S: *user + "\n"},		&expect.BExp{R: "password:"},		&expect.BSnd{S: *pass + "\n"},		&expect.BExp{R: "ftp>"},		&expect.BSnd{S: "bin\n"},		&expect.BExp{R: "ftp>"},		&expect.BSnd{S: "prompt\n"},		&expect.BExp{R: "ftp>"},		&expect.BSnd{S: "mget *\n"},		&expect.BExp{R: "ftp>"},		&expect.BSnd{S: "bye\n"},	}, timeout 	fmt.Println term.Greenf "All done"  Using the expect.Batcher makes the standard Send/Expect interactions more compact and simpler to write.
google-readmegoogle-goexpect.md	SSH	With the SSH login example we test out the  expect.Caser and the  Case Tags Also for this we'll use the Go Expect native  SSH Spawner instead of spawning a process.+ "Login: "+ "Password: "+ "Wrong password"+ "Login"+ "Password: "+ router#package mainimport  	"flag"	"fmt"	"log"	"regexp"	"time"	"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh"	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"	"github.com/google/goexpect"	"github.com/google/goterm/term" const  	timeout = 10  var  	addr  = flag.String "address", "", "address of telnet server" 	user  = flag.String "user", "user", "username to use" 	pass1 = flag.String "pass1", "pass1", "password to use" 	pass2 = flag.String "pass2", "pass2", "alternate password to use"  func main   {	flag.Parse  	fmt.Println term.Bluef "SSH Example"  	sshClt, err := ssh.Dial "tcp", *addr, &ssh.ClientConfig{		User:		Auth:		HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey  ,	} 	if err != nil {		log.Fatalf "ssh.Dial %q  failed: %v", *addr, err 	}	defer sshClt.Close  	e, _, err := expect.SpawnSSH sshClt, timeout 	if err != nil {		log.Fatal err 	}	defer e.Close  	e.ExpectBatch   expect.Batcher{		&expect.BCas{  expect.Caser{		}},	}, timeout 	fmt.Println term.Greenf "All done"

google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Google APIs Node.js Client	The API endpoints are automatically generated, so if the API is not in the list, it is currently not supported by this API client library.Supported APIs are listed on the  Google APIs Explorer  apiexplorer .
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Working with Google Cloud Platform APIs?	If you're working with  Google Cloud Platform  cloudplatform  APIs such as Datastore, Cloud Storage or Pub/Sub, consider using the  @google-cloud  googlecloud  client libraries: single purpose idiomatic Node.js clients for Google Cloud Platform services.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Installation	This library is distributed on npm
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Installation	In order to add it as a dependency, run the following command:This is a very simple example
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Installation	This creates a Blogger client and retrieves the details of a blog given the blog Id: jsconst {google} = require 'googleapis' ;// Each API may support multiple version
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Installation	With this sample, we're getting// v3 of the blogger API, and using an API key to authenticate.const blogger = google.blogger {  version: 'v3',  auth: 'YOUR API KEY'} ;const params = {  blogId: 3213900// get the blog detailsblogger.blogs.get params,  err, res  => {  if  err  {  }  console.log Instead of using callbacks you can also use promises!There are a lot of  samples  🤗  If you're trying to figure out how to use an API ..
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Installation	look there first! If there's a sample you need missing, feel free to file an  issue  bugs .
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Reference API	This library provides generated  Reference API documentation 
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Authentication and authorization	The are three primary ways to authenticate to Google APIs
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Authentication and authorization	Some service support all authentication methods, other may only support one or two.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	OAuth2 client	This client comes with an  OAuth2  oauth  client that allows you to retrieve an access token and refreshes the token and retry the request seamlessly The basics of Google's OAuth2 implementation is explained on  Google Authorization and Authentication documentation  authdocs .In the following examples, you may need a CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and REDIRECT_URL
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	OAuth2 client	You can find these pieces of information by going to the  Developer Console  devconsole , clicking your project --> APIs & auth --> credentials.For more information about OAuth2 and how it works,  see here  oauth .A complete sample application that authorizes and authenticates with the OAuth2 client is available at  samples/oauth2.js  oauthexample .
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Generating an authentication URL	To ask for permissions from a user to retrieve an access token, you redirect them to a consent page
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Generating an authentication URL	To create a consent page URL: jsconst {google} = require 'googleapis' ;const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2   YOUR_CLIENT_ID,  YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,  YOUR_REDIRECT_URL ;// generate a url that asks permissions for Google+ and Google Calendar scopesconst scopes =    '  ' ;const url = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl {  // 'online'  default  or 'offline'  gets refresh_token   access_type: 'offline',  scope: scopes} ;**IMPORTANT NOTE*
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Retrieve authorization code	Once a user has given permissions on the consent page, Google will redirect the page to the redirect URL you have provided with a code query parameter.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Retrieve access token	With the code returned, you can ask for an access token as shown below:
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Handling refresh tokens	Access tokens expire
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Handling refresh tokens	This library will automatically use a refresh token to obtain a new access token if it is about to expire
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Handling refresh tokens	An easy way to make sure you always store the most recent tokens is to use the tokens event:
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Using API keys	You may need to send an API key with the request you are going to make
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Using API keys	The following uses an API key to make a request to the Google+ API service to retrieve a person's profile given a userId: jsconst {google} = require 'googleapis' ;const plus = google.plus {  version: 'v1',  auth: 'YOUR_API_KEY' // specify your API key here} ;async function main   {  const res = await plus.people.get { userId: 'me' } ;  console.log Hello ${res.data.displayName}! ;main  .catch console.error ;To learn more about API keys, please see the  documentation  usingkeys .
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Service to Service Authentication	Rather than manually creating an OAuth2 client, JWT client, or Compute client, the auth library can create the correct credential type for you, depending upon the environment your code is running under.For example, a JWT auth client will be created when your code is running on your local developer machine, and a Compute client will be created when the same code is running on a configured instance of Google Compute Engine.The code below shows how to retrieve a default credential type, depending upon the runtime environment
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Service to Service Authentication	The createScopedRequired must be called to determine when you need to pass in the scopes manually, and when they have been set for you automatically based on the configured runtime environment.async function main    {  // environment variables
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Service to Service Authentication	 const auth = await google.auth.getClient {  } ;  const project = await google.auth.getDefaultProjectId  ;  const res = await compute.zones.list { project, auth } ;  console.log res.data ;main  .catch console.error ;
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Setting global or service-level auth	You can set the auth as a global or service-level option so you don't need to specify it every request
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Setting global or service-level auth	For example, you can set auth as a global option: jsconst {google} = require 'googleapis' ;const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2   YOUR_CLIENT_ID,  YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,  YOUR_REDIRECT_URL ;// set auth as a global defaultgoogle.options {  auth: oauth2Client} ;Instead of setting the option globally, you can also set the authentication client at the service-level: jsconst {google} = require 'googleapis' ;const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2   YOUR_CLIENT_ID,  YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,  YOUR_REDIRECT_URL ;const drive = google.drive {  version: 'v2',  auth: oauth2Client} ;See the  Options section  options  for more information.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Specifying request body	The body of the request is specified in the requestBody parameter object of the request
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Specifying request body	The body is specified as a JavaScript object with key/value pairs
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Specifying request body	For example, this sample creates a watcher that posts notifications to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic when emails are sent to a gmail account:This client supports multipart media uploads
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Specifying request body	The resource parameters are specified in the requestBody parameter object, and the media itself is specified in the media.body parameter with mime-type specified in media.mimeType.This example uploads a plain text file to Google Drive with the title "Test" and contents "Hello World"
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Specifying request body	jsconst drive = google.drive {  version: 'v3',  auth: oauth2Client} ;const res = await drive.files.create {  requestBody: {  },  media: {  }} ;You can also upload media by specifying media.body as a  Readable stream  stream 
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Specifying request body	This can allow you to upload very large files that cannot fit into memory.const fs = require 'fs' ;const drive = google.drive {  version: 'v3',  auth: oauth2Client} ;async function main   {  const res = await drive.files.create {  } ;  console.log res.data ;main  .catch console.error ;For more examples of creation and modification requests with media attachments, take a look at the samples/drive/upload.js sample.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Request Options	For more fine-tuned control over how your API calls are made, we provide you with the ability to specify additional options that can be applied directly to the  'axios'  axios  object used in this library to make network calls to the API.You may specify additional options either in the global google object or on a service client basis
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Request Options	 The options you specify are attached to the axios object so whatever axios supports, this library supports
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Request Options	You may also specify global or per-service request parameters that will be attached to all API calls you make.A full list of supported options can be  found here  requestopts .
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Global options	You can choose default options that will be sent with each request
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Global options	These options will be used for every service instantiated by the google client
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Global options	In this example, the timeout property of AxiosRequestConfig will be set for every request:You can also specify options when creating a service client.Similar to the examples above, you can also modify the parameters used for every call of a given service:const blogger = google.blogger {  version: 'v3',  // All requests made with this service client will contain the  // blogId query parameter unless overridden in individual API calls
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Global options	 params: {  }} ;// Calls with this drive client will NOT contain the blogId query parameter.const drive = google.drive 'v3' ;
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Request-level options	You can specify an auth object to be used per request
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Request-level options	Each request also inherits the options specified at the service level and global level.For example:const {google} = require 'googleapis' ;const bigquery = google.bigquery 'v2' ;async function main   {  // environment variables
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Request-level options	 const client = await google.auth.getClient {  } ;  };  console.log res.data ;main  .catch console.error ;You can also override *axiosFor example:You can use the following environment variables to proxy HTTP and HTTPS requests:
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	Getting Supported APIs	You can programatically obtain the list of supported APIs, and all available versions:
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	TypeScript	This library is written in TypeScript, and provides types out of the box
google-readmegoogle-google-api-nodejs-client.md	TypeScript	All classes and interfaces generated for each API are exported under the ${apiName}_${version} namespace

google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Making Requests ###	The classes used to call the API in  google-api-php-client-services  are autogenerated
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Making Requests ###	They map directly to the JSON requests and responses found in the  APIs Explorer A JSON request to the  Datastore API  would look like this:POST }Using this library, the same call would look something like this:// create the datastore service class$datastore = new Google_Service_Datastore $client ;// build the query $query = new Google_Service_Datastore_Query    ;// build the request and response$request = new Google_Service_Datastore_RunQueryRequest  'query' => $query  ;$response = $datastore->projects->runQuery 'YOUR_DATASET_ID', $request ;However, as each property of the JSON API has a corresponding generated class, the above code could also be written like this:// create the datastore service class$datastore = new Google_Service_Datastore $client ;// build the query$request = new Google_Service_Datastore_RunQueryRequest  ;$query = new Google_Service_Datastore_Query  ;$order->setDirection 'descending' ;$property = new Google_Service_Datastore_PropertyReference  ;$property->setName 'title' ;$order->setProperty $property ;$query->setOrder  $order  ;$kind->setName 'Book' ;$query->setKinds  $kind  ;// add the query to the request and make the request$request->setQuery $query ;$response = $datastore->projects->runQuery 'YOUR_DATASET_ID', $request ;The method used is a matter of preference, but *it will be very difficult to use this library without first understanding the JSON syntax for the API*, so it is recommended to look at the  APIs Explorer  before using any of the services here.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Making HTTP Requests Directly ###	If Google Authentication is desired for external applications, or a Google API is not available yet in this library, HTTP requests can be made directly.The authorize method returns an authorized  Guzzle Client  so any request made using the client will contain the corresponding authorization.// create the Google client$client = new Google_Client  ;$client->useApplicationDefaultCredentials  ;$client->addScope Google_Service_Plus::PLUS_ME ;// returns a Guzzle HTTP Client$httpClient = $client->authorize  ;// make an HTTP request$response = $httpClient->get '
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Caching ###	It is recommended to use another caching library to improve performance
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Caching ###	This can be done by passing a  PSR-6  compatible library to the client:use League\Flysystem\Adapter\Local;use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;use Cache\Adapter\Filesystem\FilesystemCachePool;$filesystemAdapter = new Local __DIR__.'/' ;$cache = new FilesystemCachePool $filesystem ;$client->setCache $cache ;In this example we use  PHP Cache  Add this to your project with composer:When using  Refresh Tokens  or  Service Account Credentials  it may be useful to perform some action when a new access token is granted
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Caching ###	To do this, pass a callable to the setTokenCallback method on the client:It is often very useful to debug your API calls by viewing the raw HTTP request
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Caching ###	This library supports the use of  Charles Web Proxy  Download and run Charles, and then capture all HTTP traffic through Charles with the following code:// FOR DEBUGGING ONLY$httpClient = new GuzzleHttp\Client    ;$client = new Google_Client  ;$client->setHttpClient $httpClient ;Now all calls made by this library will appear in the Charles UI.One additional step is required in Charles to view SSL requests
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Caching ###	Go to **Charles > Proxy > SSL Proxying Settings*

google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	How Do I Contribute? ##	In particular, we love pull requests 
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	What do I do if something isn't working? ###	For support with the library the best place to ask is via the google-api-php-client tag on StackOverflow: If there is a specific bug with the library, please  file a issue  in the Github issues tracker, including an example of the failing code and any specific errors retrieved
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	What do I do if something isn't working? ###	Feature requests can also be filed, as long as they are core library requests, and not-API specific: for those, refer to the documentation for the individual APIs for the best place to file requests
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	What do I do if something isn't working? ###	Please try to provide a clear statement of the problem that the feature would address.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	I want an example of X! ###	If X is a feature of the library, file away! If X is an example of using a specific service, the best place to go is to the teams for those specific APIs 
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Why do you still support 5.2? ###	When we started working on the 1.0.0 branch we knew there were several fundamental issues to fix with the 0.6 releases of the library
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Why do you still support 5.2? ###	At that time we looked at the usage of the library, and other related projects, and determined that there was still a large and active base of PHP 5.2 installs
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Why do you still support 5.2? ###	You can see this in statistics such as the PHP versions chart in the WordPress stats:  We will keep looking at the types of usage we see, and try to take advantage of newer PHP features where possible.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Why does Google_..._Service have weird names? ###	The _Service classes are generally automatically generated from the API discovery documents:  Sometimes new features are added to APIs with unusual names, which can cause some unexpected or non-standard style naming in the PHP classes.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	How do I deal with non-JSON response types? ###	Some services return XML or similar by default, rather than JSON, which is what the library supports
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	How do I deal with non-JSON response types? ###	You can request a JSON response by adding an 'alt' argument to optional params that is normally the last argument to a method call:The library strips out nulls from the objects sent to the Google APIs as its the default value of all of the uninitialized properties
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	How do I deal with non-JSON response types? ###	To work around this, set the field you want to null to Google_Model::NULL_VALUE
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	How do I deal with non-JSON response types? ###	This is a placeholder that will be replaced with a true null when sent over the wire.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Code Quality ##	Run the PHPUnit tests with PHPUnit
google-readmegoogle-google-api-php-client.md	Code Quality ##	You can configure an API key and token in BaseTest.php to run all calls, but this will require some setup on the Google Developer Console.

google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Basic usage	To use an API, include the corresponding generated file and instantiate the service
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Basic usage	For example to use the Drive API:require 'google/apis/drive_v2'Drive = Google::Apis::DriveV2 # Alias the moduledrive = Drive::DriveService.newdrive.authorization = ..
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Basic usage	# See Googleauth or Signet libraries
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Search for files in Drive  first page only 	files = drive.list_files q: "title contains 'finances'" files.items.each do |file|  puts file.title
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Upload a file	metadata = Drive::File.new title: 'My document' metadata = drive.insert_file metadata, upload_source: 'test.txt', content_type: 'text/plain' 
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Download a file	drive.get_file metadata.id, download_dest: '/tmp/myfile.txt' 
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Naming conventions vs JSON representation	Object properties in the ruby client use the standard ruby convention for naming -
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Media	Methods that allow media operations have additional parameters to specify the upload source or download destination.For uploads, the upload_source parameter can be specified with either a path to a file, an IO stream, or StringIOFor downloads, the download_dest parameter can also be either a path to a file, an IO stream, or StringIO instance.Both uploads & downloads are resumable
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Media	If an error occurs during transmission the request will be automaticallyretried from the last received byte.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Errors & Retries	Retries are disabled by default, but enabling retries is strongly encouraged
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Errors & Retries	The number of retries can be configuredvia Google::Apis::RequestOptions
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Errors & Retries	Any number greater than 0 will enable retries.To enable retries for all services:request options:an exponentially increasing delay on subsequent retries
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Errors & Retries	If a request can not be retried or if the maximum numberof retries is exceeded, an exception is thrown.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Callbacks	A block can be specified when making calls
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Callbacks	If present, the block will be called with the result or error, rather thanreturning the result from the call or raising the error
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Callbacks	Example:is complete.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Paging	To fetch multiple pages of data, use the Enumerable that automatically fetches additional pages as needed.Multiple requests can be batched together into a single HTTP request to reduce overhead
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Paging	Batched calls are executedin parallel and the responses processed once all results are availableHowever, some APIs support batch uploads
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Paging	To upload multiple files in a batch, use the batch_upload method instead.Batch uploads should only be used when uploading multiple small files
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Paging	For large files, upload files individually totake advantage of the libraries built-in resumable upload support.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Hashes	While the API will always return instances of schema classes, plain hashes are accepted in method calls forconvenience
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Hashes	Hash keys must be symbols matching the attribute names on the corresponding object the hash is meantto replace
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Hashes	For example:To handle JSON serialization or deserialization in the application, set skip_serialization oror skip_deserializaton options respectively
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Hashes	When setting skip_serialization in a request,the body object must be a string representing the serialized JSON.When setting skip_deserialization to true, the response from the API will likewisebe a string containing the raw JSON from the server.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization	 OAuth 2  is used to authorize applications
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization	This library usesboth  Signet  and Google Auth Library for Ruby  for OAuth 2 support.The  Google Auth Library for Ruby  provides an implementation of application default credentials  for Ruby
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization	It offers a simple way to get authorization credentials for use incalling Google APIs, best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identityand authorization level for the application independent of the user
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization	This isthe recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly whenyou're building an application that uses Google Compute Engine.For per-user authorization, use  Signet  to obtain user authorization.
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Passing authorization to requests	Authorization can be specified for the entire client, for an individual service instance, or on a per-request basis.Set authorization for all service:drive = Google::Apis::DriveV2::DriveService.newdrive.authorization = authorization
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	All requests made with this service will use the same authorization	Some APIs allow using an API key instead of OAuth2 tokens
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	All requests made with this service will use the same authorization	For these APIs, setthe key attribute of the service instance
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	All requests made with this service will use the same authorization	For example:require 'google/apis/translate_v2'translate = Google::Apis::TranslateV2::TranslateService.newtranslate.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'result = translate.list_translations 'Hello world!', 'es', source: 'en' puts result.translations.first.translated_text
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization using environment variables	The  GoogleAuth Library for Ruby  also supports authorization viaenvironment variables if you do not want to check in developer credentialsor private keys
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization using environment variables	Simply set the following variables for your application:The client includes a Logger instance that can be used to capture debugging information.When running in a Rails environment, the client will default to using ::Rails.logger
google-readmegoogle-google-api-ruby-client.md	Authorization using environment variables	If youprefer to use a separate logger instance for API calls, you can provide a new logger instance:To set the logging level for the client:See the  samples  for examples on how to use the client library for variousContributions for additional samples are welcome

google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Ways to authenticate	The  Application Default Credentials    provide a simple way to get authorization credentials for use in calling Google APIs.They are best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identity and authorization level for the application independent of the user
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Ways to authenticate	This is the recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly when you're building an application that uses Google Cloud Platform.
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Download your Service Account Credentials JSON file	To use Application Default Credentials, You first need to download a set of JSON credentials for your project
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Download your Service Account Credentials JSON file	Go to **APIs & Auth*> This file is your *only copy> committed with your source code, and should be stored securely.Once downloaded, store the path to this file in the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable.

google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Enable the API you want to use	Go to **APIs & Auth*
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Choosing the correct credential type automatically	Rather than manually creating an OAuth2 client, JWT client, or Compute client, the auth library can create the correct credential type for you, depending upon the environment your code is running under.For example, a JWT auth client will be created when your code is running on your local developer machine, and a Compute client will be created when the same code is running on Google Cloud Platform
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Choosing the correct credential type automatically	If you need a specific set of scopes, you can pass those in the form of a string or an array into the auth.getClient method.The code below shows how to retrieve a default credential type, depending upon the runtime environment.const {auth} = require 'google-auth-library' ; */async function main   {  const client = await auth.getClient {  } ;  const projectId = await auth.getDefaultProjectId  ;  const url = {projectId};  const res = await client.request { url } ;  console.log res.data ;async function getADC   {  // Acquire a client and the projectId based on the environment

google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	OAuth2	This library comes with an  OAuth2  oauth  client that allows you to retrieve an access token and refreshes the token and retry the request seamlessly if you also provide an expiry_date and the token is expired
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	OAuth2	The basics of Google's OAuth2 implementation is explained on  Google Authorization and Authentication documentation  authdocs .In the following examples, you may need a CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and REDIRECT_URL
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	OAuth2	You can find these pieces of information by going to the  Developer Console  devconsole , clicking your project > APIs & auth > credentials.For more information about OAuth2 and how it works,  see here  oauth .

google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Handling token events	This library will automatically obtain an access_token, and automatically refresh the access_token if a refresh_token is present
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Handling token events	 The refresh_token is only returned on the  first authorization  so if you want to make sure you store it safely
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Handling token events	An easy way to make sure you always store the most recent tokens is to use the tokens event:const client = await auth.getClient  ;client.on 'tokens',  tokens  => {  if  tokens.refresh_token  {  }  console.log tokens.access_token ;} ;const url = 
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Retrieve access token	With the code returned, you can ask for an access token as shown below:If you need to manually refresh the access_token associated with your OAuth2 client, ensure the call to generateAuthUrl sets the access_type to offline
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Retrieve access token	 The refresh token will only be returned for the first authorization by the user
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Retrieve access token	 To force consent, set the prompt property to consent:After obtaining and storing an access_token, at a later time you may want to go check the expiration date,original scopes, or audience for the token
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Retrieve access token	 To get the token info, you can use the getTokenInfo method:// after acquiring an oAuth2Client...const tokenInfo = await oAuth2client.getTokenInfo 'my-access-token' ;// take a look at the scopes originally provisioned for the access tokenconsole.log tokenInfo.scopes ;This method will throw if the token is invalid.
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	OAuth2 with Installed Apps  Electron 	If you're authenticating with OAuth2 from an installed application  like Electron , you may not want to embed your client_secret inside of the application sources

google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Loading credentials from environment variables	Instead of loading credentials from a key file, you can also provide them using an environment variable and the GoogleAuth.fromJSON   method
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-nodejs.md	Loading credentials from environment variables	 This is particularly convenient for systems that deploy directly from source control  Heroku, App Engine, etc .Start by exporting your credentials:Now you can create a new client from the credentials:const {auth} = require 'google-auth-library' ;// load the environment variable with our keysconst keysEnvVar = process.env 'CREDS' ;if  !keysEnvVar  {  throw new Error 'The $CREDS environment variable was not found!' ;const keys = JSON.parse keysEnvVar ;async function main   {  // load the JWT or UserRefreshClient from the keys  const client = auth.fromJSON keys ;  client.scopes =  ' ;  await client.authorize  ;  const url = {keys.project_id};  const res = await client.request {url} ;  console.log res.data ;main  .catch console.error ;

google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Description	This is Google's officially supported PHP client library for using OAuth 2.0authorization and authentication with Google APIs.
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Installing via Composer	The recommended way to install the google auth library is through Composer This library provides an implementation of application default credentials  application default credentials  for PHP.The Application Default Credentials provide a simple way to get authorizationcredentials for use in calling Google APIs.They are best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identityand authorization level for the application independent of the user
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Installing via Composer	This isthe recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly whenyou're building an application that uses Google Compute Engine.
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Download your Service Account Credentials JSON file	To use Application Default Credentials, You first need to download a set ofJSON credentials for your project
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Download your Service Account Credentials JSON file	Go to **APIs & Auth*the  Google Developers Console  developer console  and select**Service account*> This file is your *only copy> committed with your source code, and should be stored securely.Once downloaded, store the path to this file in theGOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable.> Consider using .htaccess or apache configuration files as well.
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Enable the API you want to use	Before making your API call, you must be sure the API you're calling has beenenabled
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Enable the API you want to use	Go to **APIs & Auth* Google Developers Console  developer console  and enable the APIs you'd like tocall
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Enable the API you want to use	For the example below, you must enable the Drive API.
google-readmegoogle-google-auth-library-php.md	Call the APIs	As long as you update the environment variable below to point to *yourcredentials file, the following code should output a list of your Drive files.use Google\Auth\ApplicationDefaultCredentials;use GuzzleHttp\Client;use GuzzleHttp\HandlerStack;// specify the path to your application credentialsputenv 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/credentials.json' ;// define the scopes for your API call$scopes =  ' ;// create middleware$middleware = ApplicationDefaultCredentials::getMiddleware $scopes ;$stack = HandlerStack::create  ;$stack->push $middleware ;// create the HTTP client$client = new Client    'handler' => $stack,  'base_uri' => '  'auth' => 'google_auth'  // authorize all requests  ;// make the request$response = $client->get 'drive/v2/files' ;// show the result!print_r  string  $response->getBody   ;

google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Google Authenticator PAM module	Example PAM module demonstrating two-factor authentication
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Google Authenticator PAM module	 
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Build & install	If you don't have access to "sudo", you have to manually become "root" priorto calling "make install".
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up the PAM module for your system	For highest security, make sure that both password and OTP are being requestedeven if password and/or OTP are incorrect
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up the PAM module for your system	This means that *at leastof pam_google_authenticator.so should be set as required, not requisite
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up the PAM module for your system	Itprobably can't hurt to have both be required, but it could depend on the restof your PAM config.If you use HOTP  counter based as opposed to time based  then add the optionno_increment_hotp to make sure the counter isn't incremented for failedAdd this line to your PAM configuration file:  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so no_increment_hotp
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up a user	Run the google-authenticator binary to create a new secret key in your homedirectory
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up a user	These settings will be stored in ~/.google_authenticator.If your system supports the "libqrencode" library, you will be shown a QRCodethat you can scan using the Android "Google Authenticator" application.If your system does not have this library, you can either follow the URL thatgoogle-authenticator outputs, or you have to manually enter the alphanumericsecret key into the Android "Google Authenticator" application.In either case, after you have added the key, click-and-hold until the contextmenu shows
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up a user	Then check that the key's verification value matches  this featuremight not be available in all builds of the Android application .Each time you log into your system, you will now be prompted for your TOTP code time based one-time-password  or HOTP  counter-based , depending on optionsgiven to google-authenticator, after having entered your normal user id andyour normal UNIX account password.During the initial roll-out process, you might find that not all users havecreated a secret key yet
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Setting up a user	If you would still like them to be able to login, you can pass the "nullok" option on the module's command line:  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Encrypted home directories	If your system encrypts home directories until after your users entered theirpassword, you either have to re-arrange the entries in the PAM configurationfile to decrypt the home directory prior to asking for the OTP code, oryou have to store the secret file in a non-standard location:  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so secret=/var/unencrypted-home/${USER}/.google_authenticatorwould be a possible choice
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Encrypted home directories	Make sure to set appropriate permissions
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Encrypted home directories	You alsohave to tell your users to manually move their .google_authenticator file tothis location.In addition to "${USER}", the ${HOME} as short-hands for the user's home directory.When using the secret= option, you might want to also set the user=option
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Encrypted home directories	The latter forces the PAM module to switch to a dedicated hard-codeduser id prior to doing any file operations
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	Encrypted home directories	When using the user= option, youmust not include "~" or "${HOME}" in the filename.The user= option can also be useful if you want to authenticate users who donot have traditional UNIX accounts on your system.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	secret=/path/to/secret/file	See "encrypted home directories", above.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	authtok_prompt=prompt	Overrides default token prompt
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	authtok_prompt=prompt	If you want to include spaces in the prompt,wrap the whole argument in square brackets:  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so  authtok_prompt=Your secret token:  
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	user=some-user	Force the PAM module to switch to a hard-coded user id prior to doing any fileoperations
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	user=some-user	Commonly used with secret=.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	no_strict_owner	DANGEROUS OPTION!By default the PAM module requires that the secrets file must be owned the userlogging in  or if user= is specified, owned by that user 
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	no_strict_owner	This optiondisables that check.This option can be used to allow daemons not running as root to still handleconfiguration files not owned by that user, for example owned by the users
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	allowed_perm=0nnn	DANGEROUS OPTION!By default, the PAM module requires the secrets file to be readable only by theowner of the file  mode 0600 by default 
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	allowed_perm=0nnn	In situations where the module is usedin a non-default configuration, an administrator may need more lenient filepermissions, or a specific setting for their use case.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	debug	Enable more verbose log messages in syslog.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	try_first_pass / use_first_pass / forward_pass	Some PAM clients cannot prompt the user for more than just the password
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	try_first_pass / use_first_pass / forward_pass	Towork around this problem, this PAM module supports stacking
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	try_first_pass / use_first_pass / forward_pass	If you pass theforward_pass option, the pam_google_authenticator module queries the userfor both the system password and the verification code in a single prompt.It then forwards the system password to the next PAM module, which will haveto be configured with the use_first_pass option.In turn, use_first_pass and try_first_pass options
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	try_first_pass / use_first_pass / forward_pass	But most users would not needto set those on the pam_google_authenticator.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	noskewadj	If you discover that your TOTP code never works, this is most commonly theresult of the clock on your server being different from the one on your Androiddevice
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	noskewadj	The PAM module makes an attempt to compensate for time skew
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	noskewadj	You canteach it about the amount of skew that you are experiencing, by trying to logit three times in a row
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	noskewadj	Make sure you always wait 30s  but not longer , sothat you get three distinct TOTP codes.Some administrators prefer that time skew isn't adjusted automatically, asdoing so results in a slightly less secure system configuration
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	noskewadj	If you wantto disable it, you can do so on the module command line:  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so noskewadj
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	no_increment_hotp	Don't increment the counter for failed HOTP attempts
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	no_increment_hotp	 Normally you should setthis so failed password attempts by an attacker without a token don't lock outthe authorized user.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	nullok	Allow users to log in without OTP, if they haven't set up OTP yet.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	echo_verification_code	By default, the PAM module does not echo the verification code when it isentered by the user
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	echo_verification_code	In some situations, the administrator might prefer adifferent behavior
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	echo_verification_code	Pass the echo_verification_code option to the modulein order to enable echoing.If you would like verification codes that are counter based instead oftimebased, use the google-authenticator binary to generate a secret key inyour home directory with the proper option
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator-libpam.md	echo_verification_code	 In this mode, clock skew isirrelevant and the window size option now applies to how many codes beyond thecurrent one that would be accepted, to reduce synchronization problems.
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator.md	Google Authenticator OpenSource	The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time passcodegenerators for several mobile platforms
google-readmegoogle-google-authenticator.md	Google Authenticator OpenSource	One-time passcodes are generated usingopen standards developed by the Initiative for Open Authentication  OATH   which is unrelated to  OAuth The pluggable authentication module  PAM  is in a separate project The Android app is in another one There is by design NO account backups in any of the apps.These apps are not on the app stores, and their code has diverged from what's inthe app stores, so patches here won't necessarily show up in those versions.These implementations support the HMAC-Based One-time Password  HOTP  algorithmspecified in  RFC 4226  and the Time-basedOne-time Password  TOTP  algorithm specifiedin  RFC 6238 Further documentation is available inthe  Wiki

google-readmegoogle-gopacket.md	GoPacket	This library provides packet decoding capabilities for Go.See  godoc  for more details
google-readmegoogle-gopacket.md	GoPacket	  ! GoDoc  Originally forked from the gopcap project written by AndreasKrennmair  
google-readmegoogle-gops.md	gops	 ! Build status   ! GoDoc  gops is a command to list and diagnose Go processes currently running on your system.For processes that starts the diagnostics agent, gops can reportadditional information such as the current stack trace, Go version, memorystats, etc.In order to start the diagnostics agent, see the  hello example  gopackage mainimport  	"log"	"time"	"github.com/google/gops/agent" func main   {	if err := agent.Listen agent.Options{} ; err != nil {		log.Fatal err 	}	time.Sleep time.Hour Otherwise, you could set GOPS_CONFIG_DIR environment variables to assign your config dir.Default, gops will use the current user's home directory AppData on windows .
google-readmegoogle-gops.md	Manual	It is possible to use gops tool both in local and remote mode.Local mode requires that you start the target binary as the same user that runs gops binary.To use gops in a remote mode you need to know target's agent address.In Local mode use process's PID as a target; in Remote mode target is a host:port combination.
google-readmegoogle-gops.md	Listing all processes running locally	To print all go processes, run gops without arguments:
google-readmegoogle-gops.md	$gops setgc  \|\  	Sets the garbage collection target to a certain percentage.The following command sets it to 10%:gops reports the Go version the target program is built with, if you run the following:To print the runtime statistics such as number of goroutines and GOMAXPROCS.
google-readmegoogle-gops.md	Pprof	gops supports CPU and heap pprof profiles
google-readmegoogle-gops.md	Pprof	After reading either heap or CPU profile,it shells out to the go tool pprof and let you interatively examine the profiles.To enter the CPU profile, run:gops allows you to start the runtime tracer for 5 seconds and examine the results.

google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy: Go running Python	   ! Join the chat at   
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Overview	Grumpy is a Python to Go source code transcompiler and runtime that is intendedto be a near drop-in replacement for CPython 2.The key difference is that itcompiles Python source code to Go source code which is then compiled to nativecode, rather than to bytecode
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Overview	This means that Grumpy has no VM
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Overview	The compiled Gosource code is a series of calls to the Grumpy runtime, a Go library serving asimilar purpose to the Python C API  although the API is incompatible withCPython's .
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Things that will probably never be supported by Grumpy	exec, eval and compile: These dynamic features of CPython are notC extension modules: Grumpy has a different API and object layout than
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Things that Grumpy will support but doesn't yet	There are three basic categories of incomplete functionality: Language features  Builtin functions and types  Standard library C locale support: Go doesn't support locales in the same way that C does
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Things that Grumpy will support but doesn't yet	As such,
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	The simplest way to execute a Grumpy program is to use make run, which wraps ashell script called grumprun that takes Python code on stdin and builds and runsthe code under Grumpy
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	All of the commands below are assumed to be run from theroot directory of the Grumpy source code distribution:For more complicated programs, you'll want to compile your Python source code toGo using grumpc  the Grumpy compiler  and then build the Go code using gobuild
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	Since Grumpy programs are statically linked, all the modules in aprogram must be findable by the Grumpy toolchain on the GOPATH
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	Grumpy looks forGo packages corresponding to Python modules in the \_\_python\_\_ subdirectoryof the GOPATH
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	By convention, this subdirectory is also used for staging Pythonsource code, making it similar to the PYTHONPATH.The first step is to set up the shell so that the Grumpy toolchain and librariescan be found
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	From the root directory of the Grumpy source distribution run:"\_\_python\_\_/hello"
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Method 1: make run:	We can also import this module into Python programsthat are built using grumprun:Compiles the given Python code to a dummy Go package, the same way weProduces a main Go package that imports the Go package from step andExecutes go run on the main package generated in step 
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Developing Grumpy	There are three main components and depending on what kind of feature you'rewriting, you may need to change one or more of these.
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	grumpc	Grumpy converts Python programs into Go programs and grumpc is the toolresponsible for parsing Python code and generating Go code from it
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	grumpc	grumpc iswritten in Python and uses the  pythonparser module to accomplish parsing.The grumpc script itself lives at tools/grumpc
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	grumpc	It is supported by a number ofPython modules in the compiler subdir.
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Runtime	The Go code generated by grumpc performs operations on data structures thatrepresent Python objects in running Grumpy programs
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Runtime	These data structures andoperations are defined in the grumpy Go library  source is in the runtimesubdir of the source distribution 
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Runtime	 This runtime is analogous to the Python CAPI and many of the structures and operations defined by grumpy havecounterparts in CPython.
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Standard Library	Much of the Python standard library is written in Python and thus "just works"in Grumpy
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Standard Library	These parts of the standard library are copied from CPython 2.7 possibly with light modifications 
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Standard Library	For licensing reasons, these files are keptin the third_party subdir.The parts of the standard library that cannot be written in pure Python, e.g.file and directory operations, are kept in the lib subdir
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Standard Library	In CPython thesekinds of modules are written as C extensions
google-readmegoogle-grumpy.md	Grumpy Standard Library	In Grumpy they are written inPython but they use native Go extensions to access facilities not otherwiseavailable in Python.

google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	gtest-parallel	_This is not an official Google product._gtest-parallel is a script that executes  GoogleTest  binaries in parallel, providing goodspeedup for single-threaded tests  on multi-core machines  and tests that do notrun at 100% CPU  on singleThe script works by listing the tests of each binary, and then executing them onworkers in separate processes
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	gtest-parallel	This works fine so long as the tests are selfcontained and do not share resources  reading data is fine, writing to the samelog file is probably not .
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Basic Usage	_For a full list of options, see --help._This shards all enabled tests across a number of workers, defaulting to thenumber of cores in the system
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Basic Usage	If your system uses Python 2, but you have nopython2 binary, run python gtest-parallel instead of ./gtest-parallel.To run only a select set of tests, run:This filter takes the same parameters as Google Test, so -Foo.\test exclusion as well
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Basic Usage	This is especially useful for slow tests  that you'renot working on , or tests that may not be able to run in parallel.
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness	Flaky tests  tests that do not deterministically pass or fail  often cause a lotof developer headache
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness	A test that fails only 1% of the time can be very hard todetect as flaky, and even harder to convince yourself of having fixed.--workers= well above the number of available core can often cause contentionand be fruitful for detecting flaky tests as well.The above command repeats all tests inside binary1, binary2 and binary3located in out/
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness	The tests are run 1000 times each on 128 workers  this ismore than I have cores on my machine anyways 
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness	This can often be done and thenleft overnight if you've no initial guess to which tests are flaky and whichones aren't
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness	When you've figured out which tests are flaky  and want to fixthem , repeat the above command with --gtest_filter= to only retry the flakytests that you are fixing.Note that repeated tests do run concurrently with themselves for efficiency, andas such they have problem writing to hard-coded files, even if they are onlyused by that single test
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness	tmpfile   and similar library functions are oftenyour friends here.
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness Summaries	Especially for disabled tests, you might wonder how stable a test seems beforetrying to enable it
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness Summaries	gtest-parallel prints summaries  number of passed/failedtests  when --repeat= is used and at least one test fails
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness Summaries	This can be used togenerate passed/failed statistics per test
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Flakiness Summaries	If no statistics are generated thenall invocations tests are passing, congratulations!For example, to try all disabled tests and see how stable they are:Which will generate something like this at the end of the run:
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Running Tests Within Test Cases Sequentially	Sometimes tests within a single test case use globally-shared resources hard-coded file paths, sockets, etc
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Running Tests Within Test Cases Sequentially	 and cannot be run in parallel
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Running Tests Within Test Cases Sequentially	Runningsuch tests in parallel will either fail or be flaky  if they happen to notoverlap during execution, they pass 
google-readmegoogle-gtest-parallel.md	Running Tests Within Test Cases Sequentially	So long as these resources are only sharedwithin the same test case gtest-parallel can still provide some parallelism.For such binaries where test cases are independent, --serialize_test_cases that runs tests within the same test case sequentially.While generally not providing as much speedup as fully parallel test execution,this permits such binaries to partially benefit from parallel execution.

google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	gVisor	gVisor is a user-space kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantialportion of the Linux system surface
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	gVisor	It includes an Open Container Initiative  OCI   oci  runtime called runsc that provides anisolation boundary between the application and the host kernel
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	gVisor	The runscruntime integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxedgVisor takes a distinct approach to container sandboxing and makes a differentset of technical trade-offs compared to existing sandbox technologies, thusproviding new tools and ideas for the container security landscape.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	Containers are not a  **sandbox**  sandbox 
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	While containers haverevolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications, runninguntrusted or potentially malicious code without additional isolation is not agood idea
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	The efficiency and performance gains from using a single, sharedkernel also mean that container escape is possible with a single vulnerability.gVisor is a user-space kernel for containers
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	It limits the host kernel surfaceaccessible to the application while still giving the application access to allthe features it expects
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	Unlike most kernels, gVisor does not assume or requirea fixed set of physical resources; instead, it leverages existing host kernelfunctionality and runs as a normal user-space process
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	In other words, gVisorimplements Linux by way of Linux.gVisor should not be confused with technologies and tools to harden containersagainst external threats, provide additional integrity checks, or limit thescope of access for a service
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why does gVisor exist?	One should always be careful about what data ismade available to a container.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	Two other approaches are commonly taken to provide stronger isolation thannative containers.**Machine-level virtualization**, such as  KVM  kvm  and  Xen  xen , exposesvirtualized hardware to a guest kernel via a Virtual Machine Monitor  VMM 
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	Thisvirtualized hardware is generally enlightened  paravirtualized  and additionalmechanisms can be used to improve the visibility between the guest and host e.g
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	balloon drivers, paravirtualized spinlocks 
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	Running containers indistinct virtual machines can provide great isolation, compatibility andperformance  though nested virtualization may bring challenges in this area ,but for containers it often requires additional proxies and agents, and mayrequire a larger resource footprint and slower start-up times.! Machine-level virtualization  g3doc/Machine-Virtualization.png "Machine-level virtualization" **Rule-based execution**, such as  seccomp  seccomp ,  SELinux  selinux  and AppArmor  apparmor , allows the specification of a fine-grained security policyfor an application or container
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	These schemes typically rely on hooksimplemented inside the host kernel to enforce the rules
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	If the surface can bemade small enough  i.e
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	a sufficiently complete policy defined , then this is anexcellent way to sandbox applications and maintain native performance
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	However,in practice it can be extremely difficult  if not impossible  to reliably definea policy for arbitrary, previously unknown applications, making this approachchallenging to apply universally.! Rule-based execution  g3doc/Rule-Based-Execution.png "Rule-based execution" Rule-based execution is often combined with additional layers forabove.gVisor intercepts application system calls and acts as the guest kernel, withoutthe need for translation through virtualized hardware
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	gVisor may be thought ofas either a merged guest kernel and VMM, or as seccomp on steroids
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	Thisarchitecture allows it to provide a flexible resource footprint  i.e
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	one basedon threads and memory mappings, not fixed guest physical resources  while alsolowering the fixed costs of virtualization
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	However, this comes at the price ofreduced application compatibility and higher per-system call overhead.! gVisor  g3doc/Layers.png "gVisor" On top of this, gVisor employs rule-based execution to provide defense-in-depth details below .gVisor's approach is similar to  User Mode Linux  UML   uml , although UMLvirtualizes hardware internally and thus provides a fixed resource footprint.Each of the above approaches may excel in distinct scenarios
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	How is gVisor different from other container isolation mechanisms?	For example,machine-level virtualization will face challenges achieving high density, whilegVisor may provide poor performance for system call heavy workloads.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why Go?	gVisor was written in Go in order to avoid security pitfalls that can plaguekernels
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why Go?	With Go, there are strong types, built-in bounds checks, nouninitialized variables, no use-after-free, no stack overflow, and a built-inrace detector
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Why Go?	 The use of Go has its challenges too, and isn't free
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Architecture	gVisor intercepts all system calls made by the application, and does thenecessary work to service them
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Architecture	Importantly, gVisor does not simply redirectapplication system calls through to the host kernel
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Architecture	Instead, gVisor implementsmost kernel primitives  signals, file systems, futexes, pipes, mm, etc
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Architecture	 and hascomplete system call handlers built on top of these primitives.Since gVisor is itself a user-space application, it will make some host systemcalls to support its operation, but much like a VMM, it will not allow theapplication to directly control the system calls it makes.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	File System Access	In order to provide defense-in-depth and limit the host system surface, thegVisor container runtime is normally split into two separate processes
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	File System Access	First,the *Sentrycode and handling system calls
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	File System Access	Second, file system operations that extendbeyond the sandbox  not internal proc or tmp files, pipes, etc
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	File System Access	 are sent to aproxy, called a *Gofer*, via a 9P connection.! Sentry  g3doc/Sentry-Gofer.png "Sentry and Gofer" The Gofer acts as a file system proxy by opening host files on behalf of theapplication, and passing them to the Sentry process, which has no host fileaccess itself
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	File System Access	Furthermore, the Sentry runs in an empty user namespace, and thesystem calls made by gVisor to the host are restricted using seccomp filters inorder to provide defense-in-depth.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Network Access	The Sentry implements its own network stack  also written in Go  called netstack  netstack 
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Network Access	All aspects of the network stack are handled inside theSentry — including TCP connection state, control messages, and packet assembly —keeping it isolated from the host network stack
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Network Access	Data link layer packets arewritten directly to the virtual device inside the network namespace setup byDocker or Kubernetes.A network passthrough mode is also supported, but comes at the cost of reducedisolation  see below .
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Platforms	The Sentry requires a *platformmapping functionality
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Platforms	Today, gVisor supports two platforms:
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Performance	There are several factors influencing performance
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Performance	The platform choice has thelargest direct impact that varies depending on the specific workload
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Performance	There isno best platform: Ptrace works universally, including on VM instances, butapplications may perform at a fraction of their original levels
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Performance	Beyond theplatform choice, passthrough modes may be useful for improving perfomance at thecost of some isolation.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Installation	These instructions will get you up-and-running sandboxed containers with gVisorand Docker.Note that gVisor can only run on x86\_64 Linux 3.17+
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Installation	In addition, gVisor onlysupports x86\_64 binaries inside the sandbox  i.e., it cannot run 32-bitbinaries .
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	The easiest way to get {yyyy-mm-dd}/runsc.sha512**It is important to copy this binary to some place that is accessible to allusers**, since runsc executes itself as user nobody to avoid unnecessaryprivileges
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	The /usr/local/bin directory is a good choice.Next, configure Docker to use runsc by adding a runtime entry to your Dockerconfiguration  /etc/docker/daemon.json 
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	You may have to create this file ifit does not exist
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	Also, some Docker versions also require you to specify the storage-driver field  docker-storage-driver .In the end, the file should look something like:this is done via:gVisor can run sandboxed containers in a Kubernetes cluster with cri-o, althoughthis is not recommended for production environments yet
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	Follow these instructions  cri-o-k8s  to run  cri-o  cri-o  on a node in a Kubernetescluster
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	Build runtime_untrusted_workload in /etc/crio/crio.conf.Any Pod without the io.kubernetes.cri-o.TrustedSandbox annotation  or with theannotation set to false  will be run with runsc.Currently, gVisor only supports Pods with a single container  not counting theever-present pause container 
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Download a Build	Support for multiple containers within a singlePod is coming soon.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Installing from Source	gVisor currently requires x86\_64 Linux to build.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Requirements	Make sure the following dependencies are installed:Clone the gVisor repo:Build and install the runsc binary.The gVisor test suite can be run with Bazel:To enable debug and system call logging, add the runtimeArgs below to yourDocker configuration  /etc/docker/daemon.json :restart the Docker daemon:with name boot will contain the strace logs from your application, which canbe useful for identifying missing or broken system calls in gVisor.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Enabling network passthrough	For high-performance networking applications, you may choose to disable the userspace network stack and instead use the host network stack
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Enabling network passthrough	Note that this modedecreases the isolation to the host.Add the following runtimeArgs to your Docker configuration /etc/docker/daemon.json  and restart the Docker daemon:Depending on hardware and performance characteristics, you may choose to use adifferent platform
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Enabling network passthrough	The Ptrace platform is the default, but the KVM platform maybe specified by passing the --platform flag to runsc in your Dockerconfiguration  /etc/docker/daemon.json :
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Checkpoint/Restore	gVisor has the ability to checkpoint a process, save its current state in astate file, and restore into a new container using the state file
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Checkpoint/Restore	For moreinformation about the checkpoint and restore commands, see the checkpoint/restore readme  checkpoint-restore .
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Will my container work with gVisor?	gVisor implements a large portion of the Linux surface and while we strive tomake it broadly compatible, there are  and always will be  unimplementedfeatures and bugs
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Will my container work with gVisor?	The only real way to know if it will work is to try
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	Will my container work with gVisor?	If youfind a container that doesn’t work and there is no known issue, please file a bug  bug  indicating the full command you used to run the image.Providing the debug logs is also helpful.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	What works?	The following applications/images have been tested:The following applications have been tested and may not yet work:
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	My container runs fine with *runc	If you’re having problems running a container with runsc it’s most likely dueto a compatibility issue or a missing feature in gVisor
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	My container runs fine with *runc	See **Debugging**,
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	When I run my container, docker fails with flag provided but not defined: -console	You're using an old version of Docker
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	When I run my container, docker fails with flag provided but not defined: -console	Refer to the Requirements  #requirements  section for the minimum version supported.
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	I can’t see a file copied with docker cp or kubectl cp.	For performance reasons, gVisor caches directory contents, and therefore it maynot realize a new file was copied to a given directory
google-readmegoogle-gvisor.md	I can’t see a file copied with docker cp or kubectl cp.	To invalidate the cacheand force a refresh, create a file under the directory in question and list thecontents again.This bug is tracked in  bug #4

google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	What is EventBinder?	GWT's EventBus is great by decoupling the components of your application, making them easy to add,modify, or remove
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	What is EventBinder?	However, using EventBus in GWT can require a lot of boilerplate in the form of implementing events, defining handler interfaces forthem, and implementing those interfaces all over your code in anonymous classes.EventBinder automates away these boring details using a strategy similar to the@UiHandler annotation defined by UiBinder.
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	How do I use it?	Easy 
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Defining events	With EventBinder, events are just immutable value types extending GenericEvent
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Defining events	If your event doesn't have any arguments, defining itonly takes one line:public class EmailLoadedEvent extends GenericEvent {  private final String subject;  private final String body;  }  public String getBody   { return body; }That's it GwtEvent or to define handler interfaces.
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Registering event handlers	Event handlers are methods annotated with the UiBinder
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Registering event handlers	Here's an example:class EmailPresenter {  interface MyEventBinder extends EventBinder {}  private final MyEventBinder eventBinder = GWT.create MyEventBinder.class ;  }  void onEmailLoaded EmailLoadedEvent event  {  }After EmailLoadedEvent is fired on the given event bus.It's possible to handle several events in one method
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Registering event handlers	In this case you mustenumerate these event classes in handles is specified and you don't need event parameter you may omit it.class SuperEvent extends GenericEvent { }class EventOne extends SuperEvent { }class EventTwo extends SuperEvent { }class FormPresenter {  interface MyEventBinder extends EventBinder {}  private final MyEventBinder eventBinder = GWT.create MyEventBinder.class ;  }  void onEventOne EventOne event  {  }  void onEventOneAndTwo SuperEvent event  {  }  void onEventOneAndTwo2   {  }
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Firing events	The last step is easy and doesn't require anything special from EventBinderapplication to be invoked in an undefined order
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	Firing events	That's it, you're done!
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	How do I install it?	If you're using Maven, you can add the following to your from <> and build it yourself
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	How do I install it?	Onceyou've installed EventBinder, be sure to inherit the module in your .gwt.xmlfile like this:
google-readmegoogle-gwteventbinder.md	1.1.0	 1 :  2 :  3 :  4 :  5 : 
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	What is GwtMockito?	Testing GWT applications using GWTTestCase can be a pain using pure Java tests, and you can't use reflection-based tools like mockingframeworks
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	What is GwtMockito?	But if you've tried to test widgets using normal test cases, you'veprobably run into this error:GwtMockito solves this and other GWT-related testing problems by allowing youto call GWT.create from JUnit tests, returning  Mockito  1  mocks.
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	How do I use it?	Getting started with GwtMockito using Junit 4.5+ is easy
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	How do I use it?	Just annotate your testwith @RunWith GwtMockitoTestRunner.class , then any calls to GWT.createencountered will return Mockito mocks instead of throwing exceptions:populate @UiFields with Mockito mocks
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	How do I use it?	Suppose you have a widget that lookslike this:public class MyWidget extends Composite {  interface MyUiBinder extends UiBinder {}  private final MyUiBinder uiBinder = GWT.create MyUiBinder.class ;  private final NumberFormatter formatter;  }  }When numberLabel with a mock object
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	How do I use it?	Since @UiFields are package-visible, they can be read from your unit tests, which lets you test this widget as follows:@RunWith GwtMockitoTestRunner.class public class MyWidgetTest {  private MyWidget widget;  public void setUp   {  }  public void shouldFormatNumber   {  }Note that GwtMockito supports the @Mock annotation from Mockito, allowing standard Mockito mocks to be mixed with mocks created by GwtMockito.That's all you need to know to get started hearing about some advanced features.
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Accessing the mock returned from GWT.create	Returning mocks from GWT.create isn't very useful if you don't have any way toverify or set behaviors on them
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Accessing the mock returned from GWT.create	You can do this by annotating a field in your test with @GwtMock to return a mock stored in that field, allowing you to reference it in yourtest
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Accessing the mock returned from GWT.create	So if you have a class that looks like@RunWith GwtMockitoTestRunner.class public class MyClassTest {  @GwtMock SomeInterface mockInterface;  public void constructorShouldSetSomething   {  }
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Returning fake objects	By default, GwtMockito will return fake implementations  which don't require youto specify mock behavior  for any classes extending the following types:GwtMockito.useProviderForType Class, FakeProvider  in your setUp method
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Returning fake objects	This will cause all calls to GWT.create for the given class or its subclassesto invoke the given FakeProvider to determine what to return
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Returning fake objects	See the javadoc reference  2  for more details.
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Mocking final classes and methods	Mockito does not normally allow final classes and methods to be mocked
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Mocking final classes and methods	This poses problems in GWT since  JavaScript overlay types  3   which include Element and its subclasses  require all methods to be final
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Mocking final classes and methods	Fortunately,GwtMockito does some classloader black magic to remove all final modifiers fromclasses and interfaces, so the following test will pass:@RunWith GwtMockitoTestRunner.class public class MyTest {  @Mock Element element;  public void shouldReturnMocksFromGwtCreate   {  }As long as your test uses GwtMockitoTestRunner, it is possible to mock anyfinal methods.
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Dealing with native methods	Under normal circumstances, JUnit tests will fail with an UnsatisfiedLinkError when encountering a native JSNI method
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Dealing with native methods	GwtMockito works around this problemusing more classloader black magic to provide no-op implementations for allnative methods using the following rules:These rules allow many tests to continue to work even when calling incindentalnative methods
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Dealing with native methods	Note that this can be dangerous always returns GWTTestCase.
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Support for JUnit 3 and other tests that can't use custom runners	Though GwtMockito.initMocks directly
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Support for JUnit 3 and other tests that can't use custom runners	A test written in this style looks like this:public class MyWidgetTest extends TestCase {  public void setUp   {  }  public void tearDown   {  }  }The test must explicitly call initMocks during its setup and tearDown whenit is being teared down, or else state can leak between tests
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Support for JUnit 3 and other tests that can't use custom runners	When instantiating a widget, the test must also subclass it and override initWidgetwith a no-op implementation, or else it will fail when this method attempts tocall Javascript
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	Support for JUnit 3 and other tests that can't use custom runners	Note that when testing in this way the features described in"Mocking final classes and methods" and "Dealing with native methods" won'twork methods without using GwtMockitoTestRunner.
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	How do I install it?	If you're using Maven, you can add the following to your from <>
google-readmegoogle-gwtmockito.md	How do I install it?	In these cases you will haveto manually install the jars for  Mockito  6  and  Javassist  7 .

google-readmegoogle-har-sanitizer.md	Description	HAR files are JSON-formatted "recordings" of web traffic activity for a user's browser session, which are often used to troubleshoot web front-ends, REST APIs, authentication issues, etc
google-readmegoogle-har-sanitizer.md	Description	 However, HAR files will capture everything in a web session, including passwords, sensitive form information, authentication cookies and headers, and any content embedded in HTTP requests
google-readmegoogle-har-sanitizer.md	Description	 This makes HAR files extremely sensitive, and highly prone to privacy breaches if handled incorrectly.This tool aims to help mitigate these concerns by offering a simple, flexible interface to redact HAR file contents of any potentially sensitive information
google-readmegoogle-har-sanitizer.md	Description	 It collects the names and values of all passwords, cookies, headers, URLQuery/POSTData/HTML-Form parameters, and embedded content mimetypes, and redacts values either already known to be sensitive, or those specified by the user
google-readmegoogle-har-sanitizer.md	Description	 It currently exists as a both a client-side web tool and Flask REST API.Live version may be found at  This is NOT an official Google product

google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Introduction	Hash functions are widely used, so it is desirable to increase their speed andsecurity
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Introduction	This package provides two 'strong'  well-distributed andunpredictable  hash functions: a faster version of SipHash, and an even fasteralgorithm we call HighwayHash.SipHash is a fast but 'cryptographically strong' pseudo-random function byAumasson and Bernstein   .HighwayHash is a new way of mixing inputs which may inspire newcryptographically strong hashes
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Introduction	Large inputs are processed at a rate of 0.24cycles per byte, and latency remains low even for small inputs
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Introduction	HighwayHash isfaster than SipHash for all input sizes, with 5 times higher throughput at 1KiB
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Introduction	We discuss design choices and provide statistical analysis and preliminarycryptanalysis in 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	Unlike prior strong hashes, these functions are fast enough to be recommendedas safer replacements for weak hashes in many applications
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	The additional CPUcost appears affordable, based on profiling data indicating C++ hash functionsaccount for less than 0.25% of CPU usage.Hash-based selection of random subsets is useful for A/B experiments and similarapplications
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	Such random generators are idempotent  repeatable anddeterministic , which is helpful for parallel algorithms and testing
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	To avoidbias, it is important that the hash function be unpredictable andindistinguishable from a uniform random generator
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	We have verified the bitdistribution and avalanche properties of SipHash and HighwayHash.64-bit hashes are also useful for authenticating short-lived messages such asnetwork/RPC packets
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	This requires that the hash function withstanddifferential, length extension and other attacks
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	We have published a formalsecurity analysis for HighwayHash
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Applications	New cryptanalysis tools may still need to bedeveloped for further analysis.Strong hashes are also important parts of methods for protecting hash tablesagainst unacceptable worst-case behavior and denial of service attacks see "hash flooding" below .128 and 256-bit hashes can be useful for verifying data integrity  checksums .
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	SipHash	Our SipHash implementation is a fast and portable drop-in replacement forthe reference C code
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	SipHash	Outputs are identical for the given test cases  messagesbetween 0 and 63 bytes .Interestingly, it is about twice as fast as a SIMD implementation using SSE4.1 This is presumably due to the lack of SIMD bit rotateinstructions prior to AVX-SipHash13 is a faster but weaker variant with one mixing round per update andthree during finalization.We also provide a data-parallel 'tree hash' variant that enables efficient SIMDwhile retaining safety guarantees
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	SipHash	This is about twice as fast as SipHash, butdoes not return the same results.
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	We have devised a new way of mixing inputs with AVX2 multiply and permuteinstructions
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	The multiplications are 32x32 -> 64 bits and therefore infeasibleto reverse
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	Permuting equalizes the distribution of the resulting bytes.The internal state occupies four 256-bit AVX2 registers
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	Due to limitations ofthe instruction set, the registers are partitioned into two 512-bit halves thatremain independent until the reduce phase
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	The algorithm outputs 64 bit digestsor up to 256 bits at no extra cost.In addition to high throughput, the algorithm is designed for low finalizationcost
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	The result is more than twice as fast as SipTreeHash.We also provide an SSE4.1 version  80% as fast for large inputs and 95% as fastfor short inputs , an implementation for VSX on POWER and a portable version 10% as fast 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	HighwayHash	A third-party ARM implementation is referenced below.Statistical analyses and preliminary cryptanalysis are given in
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Versioning and stability	Now that 21 months have elapsed since their initial release, we have declaredall  64/128/256 bit  variants of HighwayHash frozen, i.e
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Versioning and stability	unchanging forever.SipHash and HighwayHash are 'fingerprint functions' whose input -> hashmapping will not change
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Versioning and stability	This is important for applications that write hashes topersistent storage.
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Speed measurements	To measure the CPU cost of a hash function, we can either create an artificial'microbenchmark'  easier to control, but probably not representative of theactual runtime , or insert instrumentation directly into an application  risksinfluencing the results through observer overhead 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Speed measurements	We provide novel variants ofboth approaches that mitigate their respective disadvantages.profiler.h uses software write-combining to stream program traces to memorywith minimal overhead
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Speed measurements	These can be analyzed offline, or when memory is full,to learn how much time was spent in each  possibly nested  zone.nanobenchmark.h enables cycle-accurate measurements of very short functions.It uses CPU fences and robust statistics to minimize variability, and alsoavoids unrealistic branch prediction effects.We compile the 64-bit C++ implementations with a patched GCC 4.9 and run on asingle idle core of a Xeon E5-2690 v3 clocked at 2.6 GHz
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Speed measurements	CPU cost is measuredas cycles per byte for various input sizes:---------------HighwayHashAVX2  | 7.34  | 1.81 | 1.71 | 1.04 | 0.95 | 0.24HighwayHashSSE41 | 8.00  | 2.11 | 1.75 | 1.13 | 0.96 | 0.30SipTreeHash13SipHash13SipTreeHash is slower than SipHash for small inputs because it processes blocksof 32 bytes
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Speed measurements	AVX2 and SSE4.1 HighwayHash are faster than SipHash for all inputsizes due to their highly optimized handling of partial vectors.Note that previous measurements included the initialization of their input,which dramatically increased timings especially for small inputs.
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	SipTreeHash 13  requires an AVX2-capable CPU  e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	Haswell 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	HighwayHashincludes a dispatcher that chooses the best available  AVX2, SSE4.1, VSX orportable  implementation at runtime, as well as a directly callable functiontemplate that can only run on the CPU for which it was built
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	SipHash 13  andScalarSipTreeHash 13  have no particular CPU requirements.Our x86 implementations use custom vector classes with overloaded operators e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	const V4x64U a = b + c  for type-safety and improved readability vs.compiler intrinsics  e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	const __m256i a = _mm256_add_epi64 b, c  .The VSX implementation uses built-in vector types alongside Altivec intrinsics.A high-performance third-party ARM implementation is mentioned below.Our instruction_sets dispatcher avoids running newer instructions on older CPUsthat do not support them
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	However, intrinsics, and therefore also any vectorclasses that use them, require a compiler flag that also enables the compiler togenerate code for that CPU
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	This means the intrinsics must be placed in separatetranslation units that are compiled with the required flags
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	It is importantthat these source files and their headers not define any inline functions,because that might break the one definition rule and cause crashes.To minimize dispatch overhead when hashes are computed often  e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	in a loop ,we can inline the hash function into its caller using templates
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	The dispatchoverhead will only be paid once  e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	before the loop 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	CPU requirements	The template mechanismalso avoids duplicating code in each CPU-specific implementation.
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	To mitigate hash flooding attacks, we need to take both the hash function andthe data structure into account.We wish to defend  web  services that utilize hash sets/maps againstdenial-of-service attacks
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Such data structures assign attacker-controlledinput messages m to a hash table bin b by computing the hash H s, m using a hash function H seeded by s, and mapping it to a bin with somenarrowing function b = R h , discussed below.Attackers may attempt to trigger 'flooding'  excessive work in insertions orlookups  by finding multiple m that map to the same bin
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	If the attacker haslocal access, they can do far worse, so we assume the attacker can only issueremote requests
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	If the attacker is able to send large numbers of requests,they can already deny service, so we need only ensure the attacker's cost issufficiently large compared to the service's provisioning.If the hash function is 'weak', attackers can easily generate 'hash collisions' inputs mapping to the same hash values  that are independent of the seed
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Inother words, certain input messages will cause collisions regardless of the seedvalue
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	The author of SipHash has published C++ programs to generate such'universal  key-independent  multicollisions' for CityHash and Murmur
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Similar'differential' attacks are likely possible for any hash function consisting onlyof reversible operations  e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	addition/multiplication/rotation  with a constantoperand
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	n requests with such inputs cause n^2 work for an unprotected hashtable, which is unacceptable.By contrast, 'strong' hashes such as SipHash or HighwayHash require infeasibleattacker effort to find a hash collision  an expected 2^32 guesses of m perthe birthday paradox  or recover the seed  2^63 requests 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	These security claimsassume the seed is secret
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	It is reasonable to suppose s is initially unknownto attackers, e.g
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	generated on startup or even per-connection
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	A timing attackby Wool/Bar-Yosef recovers 13-bit seeds by testing all 8K possibilities usingmillions of requests, which takes several days  even assuming unrealistic 150 usround-trip times 
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	It appears infeasible to recover 64-bit seeds in this way.However, attackers are only looking for multiple R h  := h &  p easier for attackers to compute partial collisions where only the lower i bitsmatch
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	This can be prevented by choosing a prime p so that R h  := h % pincorporates all hash bits
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	The costly modulo operation can be avoided bymultiplying with the inverse  An interesting alternativesuggested by Kyoung Jae Seo chooses a random subset of the h bits
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Such an Rfunction can be computed in just 3 cycles using PEXT from the BMI2 instructionset
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	This is expected to defend against SAT-solver attacks on the hash bits at aslightly lower cost than the multiplicative inverse method, and still allowspower-of-two table sizes.Summary thus far: given a strong hash function and secret seed, it appearsinfeasible for attackers to generate hash collisions because s and/or R areunknown
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	However, they can still observe the timings of data structureoperations for various m
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	With typical table sizes of 2^10 to 2^17 entries,attackers can detect some 'bin collisions'  inputs mapping to the same bin .Although this will be costly for the attacker, they can then send many instancesof such inputs, so we need to limit the resulting work for our data structure.Hash tables with separate chaining typically store bin entries in a linked list,so worst-case inputs lead to unacceptable linear-time lookup cost
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	We insteadseek optimal asymptotic worst-case complexity for each operation  insertion,deletion and lookups , which is a constant factor times the logarithm of thedata structure size
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	This naturally leads to a tree-like data structure for eachbin
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	The Java8 HashMap only replaces its linked list with trees when needed.This leads to additional cost and complexity for deciding whether a bin is alist or tree.Our first proposal  suggested by Github user funny-falcon  avoids this overheadby always storing one tree per bin
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	It may also be worthwhile to store the firstentry directly in the bin, which avoids allocating any tree nodes in the commoncase where bins are sparsely populated
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	What kind of tree should be used?Scapegoat and splay trees only offer amortized complexity guarantees, whereastreaps require an entropy source and have higher constant factors in practice.Self-balancing structures such as 2-3 or red-black trees require additionalbookkeeping information
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	We can hope to reduce rebalancing cost by realizingthat the output bits of strong H functions are uniformly distributed
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Whenusing them as keys instead of the original message m, recent relaxed balancingschemes such as left-leaning red-black or weak AVL trees may require fewer treerotations to maintain their invariants
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Note that H already determines thebin, so we should only use the remaining bits
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	64-bit hashes are likelysufficient for this purpose, and HighwayHash generates up to 256 bits
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	It seemsunlikely that attackers can craft inputs resulting in worst cases for both thebin index and tree key without being able to generate hash collisions, whichwould contradict the security claims of strong hashes
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Even if they succeed, therelaxed tree balancing still guarantees an upper bound on height and thereforethe worst-case operation cost
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	For the AVL variant, the constant factors areslightly lower than for red-black trees.The second proposed approach uses augmented/de-amortized cuckoo hash tables These guarantee worst-case log n bounds for alloperations, but only if the hash function is 'indistinguishable from random' uniformly distributed regardless of the input distribution , which is claimedfor SipHash and HighwayHash but certainly not for weak hashes.Both alternatives retain good average case performance and defend againstflooding by limiting the amount of extra work an attacker can cause
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	The firstapproach guarantees an upper bound of log n additional work even if the hashfunction is compromised.In summary, a strong hash function is not, by itself, sufficient to protect achained hash table from flooding attacks
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	However, strong hash functions areimportant parts of two schemes for preventing denial of service
google-readmegoogle-highwayhash.md	Defending against hash flooding	Using weak hashfunctions can slightly accelerate the best-case and average-case performance ofa service, but at the risk of greatly reduced attack costs and worst-case

google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	What is it?	idaidle is a plugin for the commercial IDA Pro disassembler that warns users ifthey leave their instance idling for too long
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	What is it?	After a predetermined amount ofidle time, the plugin first warns and later then saves the current disassemlbydatabase and closes IDA.This is useful in organizations with IDA Pro floating licenses to make surethat analysts return their license to the license server when they are doneusing it.path of your IDA SDK installation:To configure for 32-bit IDA  IDA 6.95 or lower, or IDA 7.0 "old_x86" , usethe IDA 6.95 SDK and the following commands instead:Once configured, start the build with:If all goes well, depending on your configuration, the following plugin filesare now in the build directory:| OS| ------| Linux   | idaidle.so| macOS   | idaidle.dylib| Windows | idaidle.dllNote: A 64 in anywhere in any of the filenames denotes a 64-bit addressaware plugin.
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	Installation	To install system-wide, put the plugin binaries into the plugins folderin your IDA Pro installation
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	Installation	Below are the default paths:| OS| ------| Linux   | /opt/ida-7.0/plugins| macOS   | /Applications/IDA Pro 7.0/idabin/plugins  || Windows | %ProgramFiles x86 %\IDA 7.0\pluginsReplace 7.0 with your actual version number.To install just for the current user, copy the files into one of thesedirectories instead:| OS| ----------| Linux/macOS | ~/.idapro/plugins| Windows
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	Usage	As soon as a database is opened, the plugin starts to monitor idle time, i.e.the time between to consecutive UI operations
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	Usage	By default, after six hours,a warning is printed to the output window
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	Usage	After 12 hours, a databasesnapshot will be created and the IDA Pro instance will be closed withoutsaving
google-readmegoogle-idaidle.md	Usage	This is so that the plugin does not accidentally overwrite unsavedwork or databases the analyst did not want to save.There is no configuration file, but the following command-line options are| Option| --------------------------| -OIdaIdleWarningSeconds:N | Warn the user after _N_ seconds of inactivity  || -OIdaIdleTimeoutSeconds:N | Create snapshot and close IDA afer _N_ seconds |Note: IDA only recognizes these command-line options if they come _before_ any

google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Idris is a language where types are first class valuesthat is useful for theorem proving and metaprogramming
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 This package contains apartial implementation of protocol buffers in the Idris language
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 The goal isto demonstrate how Idris is capable of advanced metaprogramming that simplifiesthe implementation of protocol buffers.Protocol buffers are a way to describe a schema for serializable data
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Theschema is called a protocol buffer "message"
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 A message describes the kind ofdata that is to be serialized, and comprises a set of fields
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Each field can bea primitive type, an enum, or another message
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 In this way protocol buffersallow the description of arbitrary data types
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Below is shown a protocolmessage describing a phone number, including an enum definition for the typeof a phone number  mobile, home or work .In most languages, protocol buffers are turned into native data types by codegeneration
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 E.g
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	in C++, the generated code for the Person class will bea C++ class with methods like set_name, name and more complex method toset nested messages like phone
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 The code is generated by a compiler thattakes protocol message descriptions like the one above, parses them and emitsgenerated C++ code.However in Idris, we can avoid generating code by considering a type ofmessage descriptors  so the Person message description would be an value withthis type 
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 This is the MessageDescriptor class
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 In the protocol buffersdocumentation this is just called a Descriptor but here it's useful to bemore consistent in naming
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 The unique property of Idris is that we candefine an inductive data type InterpMessage which has MessageDescriptor forits index space, so that InterpMessage Person is the type of messages oftype Person
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Inductive data types are similar to C++ templates but with theadvantage their arguments can be any value and that value need not even beknown at compile time.In Idris we can write generic, type safe, code for working with protocolbuffers
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 In particular we have code for serialization and deserialization toand from text form
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Serialization looks likeNote that this function is generic in that d ranges over the space ofmessage descriptors, and for each d, the type of the second argument isa message of type InterpMessage d, that is a protocol message in the formatgiven by the descriptor d
google-readmegoogle-idris-protobuf.md	A partial implementation of Protocol Buffers in Idris	 Deserialization can also be done generically.

google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Docker Image Rebase	More details below, but caveat emptor.
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Using image-rebase	For purposes of illustration, imagine you've built a container imagegcr.io/my-project/my-app:latest, containing your app, and based on some OSimage, for instance, launcher.gcr.io/google/ubuntu16_04
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Using image-rebase	A vulnerability hasbeen found in the base image, and a new fixed version has been released.You could build your app image again, and its FROMlauncher.gcr.io/google/ubuntu16_04 directive would pick up the new base imagerelease, but that requires a full rebuild of your entire app from source, whichmight pull in other changes in dependencies
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Using image-rebase	You just want to release thiscritical bug fix, as quickly as possible.Instead, you could use this tool to replace the vulnerable base image layers inyour image with new patched base image layers from the newly released baseimage, without needing to rebuild from source, or indeed have access to thesource at all.check that old_base is indeed the basis for original, remove old_base'slayers from original and replace them with new_base's layers, then computeand upload a new valid manifest for the image, tagged as rebased.If the image is in Google Container Registry, you can determine old_base imagedigests using gcloud alpha container images describe

google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Caveats	Rebasing has no visibility into what the container image contains, or whatconstitutes a "valid" image
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Caveats	As a result, it's perfectly capable of producing animage that's entirely invalid garbage
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Caveats	Rebasing arbitrary layers in an image isnot a good idea.To help prevent garbage images, rebasing should only be done at a point in thelayer stack between "base" layers and "app" layers
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Caveats	These should adhere to somecontract about what "base" layers can be expected to produce, and what "app"layers should expect from base layers.In the example above, for instance, we assume that the "Ubuntu" base image isadhering to some contract with downstream app layers, that it won't remove ordrastically change what it provides to the app layer
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Caveats	If the new_base layersremoved some installed package, or made a breaking change to the version of somecompiler expected by the uppermost app layers, the resulting rebased image mightbe invalid.In general, it's a good practice to tag rebased images to some other tag thanthe original tag once it's determined the image is valid.There is ongoing work to standardize and advertise base image contractadherence to make rebasing safer.
google-readmegoogle-image-rebase.md	Automatic Rebase Seam Detection	If an app image adheres to a strong contract with its base layers, the toolthat builds the app image can insert a hint into the image, in the form of a--new_base automatically.The form of the LABEL is:in --old_base= and --new_base=.In this way, new releases of  will automatically be consideredas --new_base for the app image, if the flags aren't passed explicitly.The image-rebase tool injects this LABEL into the --rebased image itproduces, if --new_base is passed as a tag, to aid future rebase operationson that image.Using the example above, gcr.io/my-project/my-app:rebased contains the following label:Future rebase operations can be specified with just two flags:

google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	Incremental DOM is a library for building up DOM trees and updating them in-place when data changes
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	It differs from the established virtual DOM approach in that no intermediate tree is created  the existing tree is mutated in-place 
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	This approach significantly reduces memory allocation and GC thrashing for incremental updates to the DOM tree therefore increasing performance significantly in some cases.Incremental DOM is primarily intended as a compilation target for templating languages
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	It could be used to implement a higher level API for human consumption
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	The API was carefully designed to minimize heap allocations and where unavoidable ensure that as many objects as possible can be de-allocated by incremental GC
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	One unique feature of its API is that it separates opening and closing of tags so that it is suitable as a compilation target for templating languages that allow  temporarily  unbalanced HTML in templates  e.g
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Overview	tags that are opened and closed in separate templates  and arbitrary logic for creating HTML attributes.*Think of it as ASM.dom.*
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Supported Browsers	Incremental DOM supports IE9 and above.
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Usage	HTML is expressed in Incremental DOM using the elementOpen, elementClose, elementVoid and text methods
google-readmegoogle-incremental-dom.md	Usage	Consider the following example:var IncrementalDOM = require 'incremental-dom' ,function render data  {  elementVoid 'input', '',   'type', 'text'   ;  elementOpen 'div', '', null ;  elementClose 'div' ;To render or update an existing DOM node, the patch function is used:var patch = require 'incremental-dom' .patch;var data = {  text: 'Hello World!',  someCondition: truepatch myElement, function   {  render data ;} ;data.text = 'Hello World!';patch myElement, function   {  render data ;} ;

google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	Instant Hangouts	Instant Hangouts is athin wrapper that handles a bunch of the details for you:By default we display a Hangout name and information about the participants,rather than just a button to start a new Hangout.The Google API is loaded asynchronously to keep your pages fastConfiguration is very simple: just add attributes to your .
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	How it works	You serve instanthangouts.0.1.0.js
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	How it works	Then, you put the following HTML into yourpage where you want the Hangout to appear:only need our script once:We take care of loading the script asynchronously if possible so your pagesdon't wait until they've downloaded the Google API to render.Our Javascript looks at your page and finds all elements that haveclass='instanthangouts' on them
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	How it works	We read the attributes of those tags tofigure out what arguments to pass to the Google API
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	How it works	See below for the argumentsyou can put on these elements to configure your Hangouts.Next, we insert a new class='instanthangouts'
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	How it works	We then call the Google API and pass in the argumentswe read from the element, rendering the Hangout
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	How it works	This means you can have as manyHangout controls on a page as you want.
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	Modes	We support two modes: *widget
google-readmegoogle-instant-hangouts.md	Widget	Widget mode looks like this:! default hangout  images/default_hangout.png It is used by default, and can be explicitly selected by setting hangout in your HTML:end up in the same Hangout

google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Inverting Proxy and Agent	This repository defines a reverse proxy that inverts the direction of trafficbetween the proxy and the backend servers.That design makes configuring and hosting backends much simpler than whatis required for traditional reverse proxies:The communication channel between the proxy and backends can be securedThe backends do not need to be exposed to incoming requests from the proxy.
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Disclaimer	 This is not an official Google product 
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Background	A  reverse proxy  is a server thatforwards requests to one or more backend servers.Traditionally, this has been done by configuring the reverse proxy with theaddress of each backend, and then having it send a request to a backend foreach request it receives from a client.That meant each backend had to be able to receive incoming requests from theproxy
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Background	This implied one of two choices.Place the backend servers on a private network shared with the proxy.Place the backend servers on the public internet.The first choice requires the proxy and backends to be controlled by the samehosting provider, while the second requires the backends handle all of thesame overhead required for any internet hosting  SSL termination, protectionagainst DDoS attacks, etc .This project aims to limit the overhead of hosting a public server to justthe proxy while still allowing anyone to run a backend.The details of how this is accomplished are outlined below.
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Design	This project defines two components:Something that we are calling the "Inverting Proxy"An agent that runs alongside a backend and forwards requests to itThe inverting proxy can be run on App Engine
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Design	It requires incoming requests beauthenticated via the  Users API and forwards those requests to the appropriate backend, via the agent.Since neither the backend nor the agent will be accessible from the publicinternet, requests are not directly forwarded to the backend
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Design	Instead,the direction of that traffic is inverted
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Design	The agent sends a request to theinverting proxy, the proxy waits for incoming client requests, andthen the proxy responds to the request from the agent with those clientrequests in the response body.The agent then forwards those requests to the backend, takes the responsesthat it gets back, and sends them as a request to the inverting proxy.Finally, the inverting proxy extracts the backend's response from theagent's request and sends it as the response to the original clientAn example request flow looks like this:The important thing to note is that the request from the client  #2  matchesthe request to the backend  #4  and the response from the backend  #5  matchesthe response to the client  #7 .
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Components	There are two components required for the inverting proxy to work:The proxy itself, which must be accessible from the public internet.The forwarding agent, which must be able to forward requests to the backend.
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Inverting Proxy	The inverting proxy serves the same roll as a reverse proxy, but additionallyinverts the direction of traffic to the agent.We implement the inverting proxy as an App Engine app
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Inverting Proxy	The app is written inGo and its source code is under the 'app' subdirectory.
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Forwarding Agent	The agent receives the inverted traffic from the proxy and inverts it againbefore forwarding it to the backend
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Forwarding Agent	This ensures that the requests from theclient match the requests to the backend and that the responses from thebackend match the responses to the client.The forwarding agent is standalone binary written in Go and its source codeis under the 'agent' subdirectory.
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Prerequisites	First,  create a Google Cloud Platform project that will host your proxy, and ensure that you have the Google Cloud SDK  installed on your machine.
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Setup	Save the ID of your project in the environment variable PROJECT_ID, and thenrun the commandone for agents to contact, and one that implements an API for managingproxy endpoints .
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Registering Backends	Before you can connect a backend server to your proxy, you must use the proxy'sadmin API to create a record of that backend
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Registering Backends	This is just a simple HTTPREST API with create, list, and delete operations
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Registering Backends	There is no client toolprovided for the admin API, but you can access it using curl.To list the current backends:  Alternatively, you can use the special string "allUsers" to make your server public
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Registering Backends	 on the machine where the agent runs.Finally, to delete a backend:Once you have created the record for your backend using the API, you canrun the agent alongside your server with the following command:
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Limitations	Currently, the inverting proxy only supports HTTP requests
google-readmegoogle-inverting-proxy.md	Limitations	In particular,websockets are not supported, so you have to use an adapter like socket.ioif you want to use the inverting proxy with a service that requires websockets.

google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	iOS Device Control Library	The library offersthe ability to get device properties, install and start applications, takescreenshots, capture logs, and more!Examples of how to use this library can be found here  src/com/google/iosdevicecontrol/examples 
google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	iOS Device Control Library	To build the examples, run:which will create two runnable jars in the target directory.
google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	Installation	iOS Device Control only works on macOS with tethered real devices or with Xcode8+ with the simctl tool installed for the iOS Simulator.
google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	Simulator Automation	Install  Xcode 8 or above and verify the following command works:The following dependencies can be installed easily with homebrew Install libusbmuxd by building from source:Install libimobiledevice by building from source:Install ideviceinstaller by building from source:Install idevice_app_runner and idevicewebinspectorproxy by building fromsource
google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	Simulator Automation	This can be done by following the instructions outlined in theREADMEs of the respective projects in the  third_party directory  third_party .
google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	Optional Utilities	Most of the iOS Device Control library can be used with just the above tools.For additional control of real devices, the following tools can optionally beInstall  Apple Configurator 2 and install the automation tools by selecting the "Install Automation Tools..."option under the Apple Configurator 2 menu.Install the provided OpenUrl app by following the instructions here  OpenUrlApp/README  to automate Safari on real devices.
google-readmegoogle-ios-device-control.md	Troubleshooting	For real devices, make sure that both the device is trusted and the lockdownfolder has the correct permissions.

google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	iOS WebKit Debug Proxy	The ios_webkit_debug_proxy  aka _iwdp_  proxies requests from usbmuxd daemon over a websocket connection, allowing developers to send commands to MobileSafari and UIWebViews on real and simulated iOS devices.
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Installation	iOS WebKit Debug Proxy works on Linux, MacOS & Windows.On a MacOS, it's easiest to install with  homebrew On Linux  or MacOS :sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libplist-dev libplist++-dev usbmuxd libtool libimobiledevice-devgit clone cd ios-webkit-debug-proxymakesudo make install
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Usage	On Linux, you must run the usbmuxd daemon
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Usage	 The above install adds a /lib/udev rule to start the daemon whenever a device is attached
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Usage	 To verify that usbmuxd can list your attached device s , run idevice_id -l
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Start the simulator or device	The iOS Simulator is supported, but it must be started **before*Your attached iOS devices must have ≥1 open browser tabs and the inspector enabled via:  Settings > Safari > Advanced > Web Inspector = ON
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Start the proxy	ios_webkit_debug_proxy can be used with many tools such as Chrome DevTools and Safari Web Inspector.
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Chrome Devtools	To use Chrome DevTools it's the recommendation to use the  RemoteDebug/remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter  project, which has instructions on how to setup Chrome to remote debug iOS devices, much similar to Android debugging.The reason is that recent versions of Chrome and Safari there're major discrepancies between  Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol  and Apple's  Remote Web Inspector service  which means that newer versions of Chrome DevTools aren't compatible with Safari.
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Safari Web Inspector	You can use Safari Web Inspector extracted from Webkit sources, e.g
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Safari Web Inspector	 artygus/webkit-webinspector 
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Firefox DevTools via Valence	Another option is  mozilla/valence  which enables Firefox DevTools to be used with iOS.
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	View and inspect debuggable tabs	Navigate to  localhost:9221  You'll see a listing of all connected devices.Click through to view tabs available on each, and click through again to open the DevTools for a tab.
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Setting the DevTools UI URL	 Chrome DevTools UI  used as a default frontend: Chromium checkout  or another URL:Just the same, you can apply the appropriate port  9222  and page  2  values below.The -f value must end in ".html"
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Setting the DevTools UI URL	Due to security reasons, https URLs will not work; use http or force-allow with the URL bar's shield icon
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Setting the DevTools UI URL	As of Chrome 45, the primary URL  changed  from devtools.html to inspector.html.To disable the frontend proxy, use the --no-frontend argument.
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Port assigment	The default configuration works well for most developers
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Port assigment	The device_id-to-port assignment defaults to:If a port is in use then the next available port will be used, up to the range limit.The port assignment is first-come-first-serve but is preserved if a device is detached and reattached, assuming that the proxy is not restarted, e.g.:  the device list gets :9221  attach A gets :9222  attach B gets :9223  detach A, doesn't affect B's port  attach C gets :9224  not :9222   reattach A gets :9222 again  not :9225 The port assignment rules can be set via the command line with -c
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Port assigment	 The default is equivalent to:where "null" represents the device list
google-readmegoogle-ios-webkit-debug-proxy.md	Port assigment	 The following example restricts the proxy to a single device and port:

google-readmegoogle-iosched-ios.md	Google I/O iOS App	Google I/O is a developer conference held each year with two days of deeptechnical content featuring technical sessions and hundreds of demonstrationsfrom developers showcasing their technologies.This project is the iOS app for the conference.
google-readmegoogle-iosched-ios.md	Building	You'll need a Firebase project to run IOsched
google-readmegoogle-iosched-ios.md	Building	Copy your project'sGoogleService-Info.plist file into the Source/IOsched/Configurationdirectory
google-readmegoogle-iosched-ios.md	Building	For instructions on how to create an iOS app in your Firebaseproject, see the "Add Firebase to your app" section of this document CocoaPods 1.4.0 and Xcode 9.2 or higher are required.Run pod install in the Source directory, open IOsched.xcworkspace, andbuild and run the IOsched target.Note that the backend is dependent on Cloud Functions and Firestore, sowhen running the app you may not see any data if your project's Firestoredata store is empty
google-readmegoogle-iosched-ios.md	Building	Similarly, backend functions like reservationsand stars won't function.
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Features	The app displays a list of conference events reviews, codelabs, etc
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Features	types and by topics  Android, Firebase, etc
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Features	Users can see details aboutevents, and they can star events that interest them
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Features	Conference attendees canreserve events to guarantee a seat.The app also displays a map of the venue and shows informational pages to guideattendees during the conference
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Features	 
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Development Environment	The app is written entirely in Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system.To build the app, use the gradlew build command or use "Import Project" inAndroid Studio
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Development Environment	A canary or stable version >= 3.2 of Android Studio isrequired and may be downloaded here 
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Architecture	The 2018 version of the app constitutes a comprehensive rewrite
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Architecture	Thearchitecture is built around Android Architecture Components We followed the recommendations laid out in the Guide to App Architecture when deciding on the architecture for the app
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Architecture	We kept logic away fromActivities and Fragments and moved it to ViewModel We observed data using LiveData and used the  Data Binding Library to bind UI components in layouts to the app's data sources.We used a Repository layer for handling data operations
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Architecture	IOSched's data comesfrom a few different sources  Cloud Firestore  either remotely or ina local cache for offline use , user preferences and settings are stored inSharedPreferences, conference data is stored remotely and is fetched and storedin memory for the app to use, etc
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Architecture	are responsible for handling all data operations and abstracting the data sourcesfrom the rest of the app  we liked using Firestore, but if we wanted to swap itout for a different data source in the future, our architecture allows us to doso in a clean way .We implemented a lightweight domain layer, which sits between the data layerand the presentation layer, and handles discrete pieces of business logic offthe UI thread
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Architecture	See the .\*UseCase.kt files under shared/domain for examples We used  Dagger2  for dependency injectionand we heavily relied on dagger-android  to abstract awayboiler-plate code.We used  Espresso for basic instrumentation tests and JUnit and Mockito  for unit testing.
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Firebase	The app makes considerable use of the following Firebase components:for all user data  events starred or reserved by a user 
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Firebase	Firestore gave usautomatic sync  and also seamlessly managed offline functionalityfor us.allowed us to run backend code
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Firebase	The reservations feature heavily depended on CloudFunctions working in conjuction with Firestore.let us inform the app about changes to conference data on our server.manage in-app constants.
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Kotlin	We made an early decision to rewrite the app from scratch to bring it in linewith our thinking about modern Android architecture
google-readmegoogle-iosched.md	Kotlin	Using Kotlin for therewrite was an easy choice: we liked Kotlin's expressive, concise, andpowerful syntax; we found that Kotlin's support for safety features fornullability and immutability made our code more resilient; and we leveraged theenhanced functionality provided by Android Ktx extensions

google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Installation	For checking an NPM package, you canjust pass the package name  optionally together with the version  as theargument
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Installation	To check a local directory, you should pass the --localpath/to/repo argument
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Installation	To check for a GitHub PR, you should pass the --pr//pull/ argument.If the tool finds any non-green licenses in the given package or in itsdependencies, they will be printed out together with the detailedIf you pass dependencies.jsgl also checks sub-packages for --local and --pr flags when itdetects that the repository is a monorepo
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Installation	It assumes a certain directorystructure for detecting whether a repository is a monorepo: the top-leveldirectory should have the packages directory in it and sub-packages mustexist under that directory
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Installation	In that case, all the package.json files arefound from sub-packages and jsgl checks all of them.For example, when a directory , jsgl checks all of foo/package.json, foo/packages/bar/package.json,and foo/packages/baz/package.json.
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Configurations	You can customize how greenLicenses section of the configuration file
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Configurations	In that case, jsgl willuse that custom list instead of its default list.The default green license list is:You can also whitelist some NPM packages and they will be considered "green"even when they have non-green licenses or no licenses
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Configurations	It's useful whenpackage.json but has a separate LICENSE file, jsgl can't verify that.You can whitelist that package to make jsgl not complain about thatA typical configuration file looks like this:The packageWhitelist section is for the package whitelist.Note that comments are allowed in js-green-licenses.json.The configuration file must be located in the top-level directory of arepository for jsgl tries to locate the configuration file in the current local directoryfrom which jsgl is invoked.It is desirable that the license names in the greenLicenses section bevalid license IDs defined in  whenever possible.
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Interface as a Library	You can also use js-green-licenses as a library as well as a command-lineutility
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Interface as a Library	Usually the LicenseChecker class is the only one you would have to
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Instantiation	generates more verbose output.
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Use in Gulp	const jsgl = require 'js-green-licenses' ;gulp.task 'check_licenses', function   {  const checker = new jsgl.LicenseChecker {  } ;  checker.setDefaultHandlers  ;  return checker.checkLocalDirectory '.' ;} ;
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Events	A LicenseChecker object emits following events during its processing
google-readmegoogle-js-green-licenses.md	Events	circle-image :  circle-url :  codecov-image :  codecov-url :  david-dev-image :  david-dev-url :  david-image :  david-url :  npm-image :  npm-url :  snyk-image :  snyk-url : 
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	JsAction	JsAction is a tiny event delegation library that allows decoupling the DOM nodeson which the action occurs from the JavaScript code that handles the action.The traditional way of adding an event handler is to obtain a reference to thenode and add the event handler to it
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	JsAction	JsAction allows us to map between eventsand names of handlers for these events via a custom HTML attribute calledSeparately, JavaScript code registers event handlers with given names which neednot be exposed globally
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	JsAction	When an event occurs the name of the action is mappedto the corresponding handler which is executed.Finally, JsAction uncouples event handling from actual implementations
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	JsAction	Thus onemay late load the implementations, while the app is always able to respond touser actions marked up through JsAction
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	JsAction	This can help in greatly reducing pageload time, in particular for server side rendered apps.
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Building	JsAction is built using the  ClosureCompiler  You can obtain a recentcompiler from the site.JsAction depends on the  ClosureLibrary  You can obtain a copy of thelibrary from the GitHub repository.The compiler is able to handle dependency ordering automatically with the--only_closure_dependencies flag
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Building	It needs to be provided with the sources andany entry points.See the files dispatch_auto.js, eventcontract_auto.js, andeventcontract_example.js for typical entry points.Here is a typical command line for building JsAction's dispatch_auto.js:find path/to/closure-library path/to/jsaction -name "*.js" |
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Using drop-in scripts	If you would like to test out JsAction, you can link precompiled scripts intoyour page.
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Usage	You can play around with JsAction already set up with the following directionsat 
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	In the DOM	Actions are indicated with the jsaction attribute
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	In the DOM	They are separated by ;,where each one takes the form:
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Set up	const eventContract = new jsaction.EventContract  ;// Events will be handled for all elements under this container.eventContract.addContainer document.getElementById 'container'  ;// Register the event types we care about.eventContract.addEvent 'click' ;eventContract.addEvent 'dblclick' ;const dispatcher = new jsaction.Dispatcher  ;eventContract.dispatchTo dispatcher.dispatch.bind dispatcher  ;
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Register individual handlers	/*const doStuff = function flow  {  // do stuff  alert 'doStuff called!' ;dispatcher.registerHandlers 
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Late loading the JsAction dispatcher and event handlers	JsAction splits the event contract and dispatcher into two separably loadablebinaries
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Late loading the JsAction dispatcher and event handlers	This allows applications to load the small event contract early on thepage to capture events, and load the dispatcher and event handlers at a latertime
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Late loading the JsAction dispatcher and event handlers	Since captured events are queued until the dispatcher loads, this patterncan ensure that user events are not lost even if they happen before the primaryevent handlers load.Visit  to try out a working example.
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Load the contract early in the page	Just like in the regular example, in this example the event contract is loadedvery early on the page, ideally in the head of the page
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Load the contract early in the page	 const eventContract = new jsaction.EventContract  ;  eventContract.addContainer window.document.documentElement ;  eventContract.addEvent 'click' ;  click here to capture eventsThe event contract is configured to capture events for the entire page
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Load the contract early in the page	Sincethe dispatcher and event handlers are not loaded yet, the event contract willjust queue the events if the user tries to interact with the page
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Load the contract early in the page	These eventscan then be replayed after the dispatcher and event handlers are loaded, whichwill be shown in this example next
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Load the contract early in the page	This will ensure that no user interaction islost, even if it happens before the code is loaded.
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Loading the dispatcher and replaying events	At any point later in the page, the dispatcher and event handlers can be loadedand any queued events can be replayed.After the dispatcher and event handler code loads, you will configure thedispatcher just like in the regular example:// This is the actual event handler code.function handleEvent   {  alert 'event handled!' ;// Initialize the dispatcher, register the handlers, and then replay the queued events.const dispatcher = new jsaction.Dispatcher  ;eventContract.dispatchTo dispatcher.dispatch.bind dispatcher  ;dispatcher.registerHandlers There is some new code to replay the queued events:// This code replays the queued events
google-readmegoogle-jsaction.md	Loading the dispatcher and replaying events	Applications can define custom replay// strategies.function replayEvents events, jsActionDispatcher  {  while  events.length  {  }// This will automatically trigger the event replayer to run if there are// queued events.dispatcher.setEventReplayer replayEvents ;Now any events that happen during page load before the JS has loaded will bereplayed when the primary JS does load, ensuring that user interactions are not

google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	jsonapi	   ! Go Report Card   ! GoDoc  A serializer/deserializer for JSON payloads that comply to the JSON API 
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Background	You are working in your Go web application and you have a struct that isorganized similarly to your database schema
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Background	 You need to send andreceive json payloads that adhere to the JSON API spec
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Background	 Once you realize thatyour json needed to take on this special form, you go down the path ofcreating more structs to be able to serialize and deserialize JSON APIpayloads
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Background	 Then there are more models required with this additionalstructure
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Background	 Ugh! With JSON API, you can keep your model structs as is anduse  StructTags  to indicateto JSON API how you want your response built or your requestdeserialized
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Background	 What about your relationships?  JSON API supportsrelationships out of the box and will even put them in your responseinto an included side-loaded slice--that contains associated records.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Introduction	JSON API uses  StructField tags to annotate the structs fields that you already have and use inyour app and then reads and writes  JSON API output based on the instructions you give the library in your JSON APItags
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Introduction	 Let's take an example
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Introduction	 In your app, you most likely have structsthat look similar to these:type Blog struct {	ID	Title	Posts	CurrentPost   *Post	CurrentPostId int	CreatedAt	ViewCounttype Post struct {	ID	BlogID   int	Title	Body	Comments   *Comment json:"comments"type Comment struct {	IdThese structs may or may not resemble the layout of your database
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Introduction	 Butthese are the ones that you want to use right?  You wouldn't want to usestructs like those that JSON API sends because it is difficult to get atall of your data easily.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Example App	 examples/app.go This program demonstrates the implementation of a create, a show,and a list  http.Handler   Itoutputs some example requests and responses as well as serializedexamples of the source/target structs to json
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Example App	 That is to say, I showyou that the library has successfully taken your JSON API request andturned it into your struct types.To run,
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Example	out := bytes.NewBuffer nil // testModel returns a pointer to a Blogjsonapi.MarshalOnePayloadEmbedded out, testModel   h := new BlogsHandler w := httptest.NewRecorder  r, _ := http.NewRequest http.MethodPost, "/blogs", out h.CreateBlog w, r blog := new Blog jsonapi.UnmarshalPayload w.Body, blog // ..
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Example	assert stuff about blog here ...
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	primary	Tag value arguments are comma separated
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	primary	 The first argument must be,types are shown in the examples, but not required.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	relation	relationship with other structs
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	relation	JSON API will traverse the graph ofrelationships and marshal or unmarshal records
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	relation	 The first argument mustbe, relation, and the second should be the name of the relationship,used as the key in the relationships hash for the record
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	relation	The optionalthird argument is omitempty to-many from being serialized.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Methods Reference	**All Marshal and Unmarshal methods expect pointers to structinstance or slices of the same contained with the interface{}s**Now you have your structs prepared to be seralized or materialized, Whatabout the rest?
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Create Record Example	You can Unmarshal a JSON API payload using jsonapi.UnmarshalPayload It reads from an  io.Reader containing a JSON API payload for one record  but can have relatedrecords 
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Create Record Example	 Then, it materializes a struct that you created and passed in using new or & 
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Create Record Example	 Again, the method supports single records only, atthe top level, in request payloads at the moment
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Create Record Example	Bulk creates andupdates are not supported yet.After saving your record, you can use, MarshalOnePayload to write the JSON API response to an io.Writer 
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalPayload	Writes a JSON API response, with related records sideloaded, into anincluded array
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalPayload	 This method encodes a response for either a single record ormany records.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Handler Example Code	func CreateBlogs w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request  {	// ...create many blogs at once	blogs, err := UnmarshalManyPayload r.Body, reflect.TypeOf new Blog   	if err != nil {		t.Fatal err 	}	for _, blog := range blogs {		b, ok := blog
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Handler Example Code	*Blog 		// ...save each of your blogs	}	w.Header  .Set "Content-Type", jsonapi.MediaType 	w.WriteHeader http.StatusCreated 	if err := jsonapi.MarshalPayload w, blogs ; err != nil {		http.Error w, err.Error  , http.StatusInternalServerError 	}
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	UnmarshalManyPayload	Takes an io.Reader and a reflect.Type representing the uniform typecontained within the "data" JSON API member.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Links	If you need to include  link objects  along with response data, implement the Linkable interface for document-links, and RelationshipLinkable for relationship links:func  post Post  JSONAPILinks   *Links {	return &Links{		"self": "href": fmt.Sprintf "", post.ID ,		"comments": Link{		},	}// Invoked for each relationship defined on the Post struct when marshaledfunc  post Post  JSONAPIRelationshipLinks relation string  *Links {	if relation == "comments" {		return &Links{		}	}	return nil
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Meta	 If you need to include  meta objects  along with response data, implement the Metable interface for document-meta, and RelationshipMetable for relationship meta: gofunc  post Post  JSONAPIMeta   *Meta {	return &Meta{		"details": "sample details here",	}// Invoked for each relationship defined on the Post struct when marshaledfunc  post Post  JSONAPIRelationshipMeta relation string  *Meta {	if relation == "comments" {		return &Meta{		}	}	return nil
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Custom types	If you need to support custom types  e.g
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Custom types	for custom time formats , you'll need to implement the json.Marshaler and json.Unmarshaler interfaces on the type.// MyTimeFormat is a custom format I invented for funconst MyTimeFormat = "The time is 15:04:The year is 2006, and it is day 2 of January."// MyTime is a custom type used to handle the custom time formattype MyTime struct {	time.Time// UnmarshalJSON to implement the json.Unmarshaler interfacefunc  m *MyTime  UnmarshalJSON b   byte  error {	t, err := time.Parse MyTimeFormat, string b  	if err != nil {		return err	}	m.Time = t	return nil// MarshalJSON to implement the json.Marshaler interfacefunc  m *MyTime  MarshalJSON      byte, error  {	return json.Marshal m.Time.Format MyTimeFormat  
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Errors	This package also implements support for JSON API compatible errors payloads using the following types.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	go	type ErrorObject struct { ..
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	go	}// Error implements the ErrorObject is an Error implementation as well as an implementation of the JSON API error object.The main idea behind this struct is that you can use it directly in your code as an error type and pass it directly to MarshalErrors to get a valid JSON API errors payload.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalOnePayloadEmbedded	This method is not strictly meant to for use in implementation code,although feel free
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalOnePayloadEmbedded	 It was mainly created for use in tests; in most cases,your request payloads for create will be embedded rather than sideloadedfor related records
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalOnePayloadEmbedded	 This method will serialize a single struct pointerinto an embedded json response
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalOnePayloadEmbedded	 In other words, there will be no,included, array in the json; all relationships will be serializedinline with the data.However, in tests, you may want to construct payloads to post to createmethods that are embedded to most closely model the payloads that willbe produced by the client
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	MarshalOnePayloadEmbedded	 This method aims to enable that.
google-readmegoogle-jsonapi.md	Alternative Installation	I use git subtrees to manage dependencies rather than go get so thatthe src is committed to my repo.a collection of packages and GOPATH is set to the rootfolder--containing src.

google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Introduction	JWT  rfc7519  is widely used
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Introduction	However, the RFC standards JSON Web Encryption JWE   rfc7516 , JSON Web Signature  JWS   rfc7515 , JSON Web Token  JWT  rfc7519  contain several design mistakes which make both implementations anduse of JWT dangerous
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Introduction	For instance, existing research such as Critical vulnerabilities in JSON Web Token libraries  Practical Cryptanalysis of Json Web Token  High risk vulnerability in RFC 7515 showed several vulnerabilities at design and implementation level
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Introduction	Therefore, wewill only implement a safe subset of it
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Introduction	JWS Compact Serialization while not ideal, is the safest option and covers the majority of use cases.We'll harden the API to make it difficult to misuse.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Using cryptography.io	PyCrypto has a lot of vulnerabilities
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Using cryptography.io	We’ll use cryptography.io that is builton top of OpenSSL.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Do not support “none” option	This option is obviously broken at several layers.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of key configuration from signature or MAC verification	JWT allows the signature or MAC to contain public key, certificates or urlspointing to certificates
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of key configuration from signature or MAC verification	This is a design mistake because in verification,signature and MAC are under attacker control which lead to various attacks.Therefore, in our API, once the key is configured by users, it can not beaffected by attackers through signature or MAC.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of MAC and digital signature	While MAC and signature are both used to authenticate data, they’re distinctsecurity primitives
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of MAC and digital signature	MAC is symmetric key crypto, while digital signature ispublic key cryptography
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of MAC and digital signature	They have different security requirements and keymanagement assumptions
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of MAC and digital signature	Furthermore, in key rotation, accidental change fromdigital signature to MAC or vice versa changes the security properties of thesystem and jeopardizes its security.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Separation of public key verifier and signer	While it’s tempting to merge them together, for one key, the typical use case isone side generates the signature and the other side verifies the signature.Furthermore, the key protection mechanism of signer and verifier is different.For verifier, we only need to protect the integrity of the key while for signer,we have to protect both the integrity and confidentiality of the key.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	“kid”  Key ID : signed or unsigned?	“kid” is used as hint indicating which key should be used for verification.RFC7515 doesn’t specify whether “kid” should be signed or unsigned
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	“kid”  Key ID : signed or unsigned?	Forinstance,  shows an unsigned“kid”
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	“kid”  Key ID : signed or unsigned?	However, as we only support Json Compact Serialization where the headeris signed, “kid” must be signed
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	“kid”  Key ID : signed or unsigned?	This is consistent with existing use cases thatwe're aware of.
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	For JwsPublicKeyVerify, JwsMacVerify, we support key configuration that acceptsmultiple keys and “kid”
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	This feature is helpful in key rotation/update when thereceiver doesn’t know in advance which key should be used for verification
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	Themain difficulty in JWT is that at the time of parsing JWK, key type or kid don’tfully specify what algorithm will be used during sign/verify orcompute_mac/verify_mac
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	For instance, let’s look at the key:There is no way to tell whether the key should be used as encryption key or HMACkey
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	Even if we know that it’s used as HMAC key, we still don’t know what hashfunction should be used during HMAC verification
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	One way to mitigate this issueis to enforce the field “alg” as defined at Key without “alg” field isrejected
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	Note that for signer, we only support 1 key
google-readmegoogle-jws.md	Multiple keys to support key rotation/update	There are 2 reasons:

google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	WHAT IS IT?	Kafel is a language and library for specifying syscall filtering policies.The policies are compiled into BPF code that can be used with seccomp-filter.This is NOT an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Policy language	A simple language is used to define policies.A policy file has 3 parts: Constant definitions  optional  Policy definitions Top level policy declaration
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Numbers	Kafel supports following number notations:You may define numeric constants at the beging of policy file to make it moreThe defined constants can then be used anywhere where a number is expected.Policy definition is a list of action blocks and use statements separated by__samples/__ contains some example policies that demonstrate supported features.
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Use statements	A USE someOtherPolicy behaves as if someOtherPolicy body was pasted in itsplace
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Use statements	You may only use policies defined before the use statement.With use statements you can create meaningful groups of filtering rules that arebuilding blocks of bigger policies.
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Action blocks	Action block consist of a target and list of syscall matching rules separatedwith commas.Target of first rule matched is the policy decision.Following table list Kafel targets and their corresponding seccomp-filterreturn values.--------------TRACE number  | SECCOMP_RET_TRACE+number
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Syscall matching rules	A rules consist of syscall name and optional list of boolean expressions.List of boolean expressions separated by commas.A comma is semantically equivalent to || but has the lowest precedence,therefore it may be easier to read.
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Syscall naming	Normally syscalls are specified by their names as defined in Linux kernel.However, you may also filter __custom syscalls__ that are not in the standardsyscall list.You can either define a constant and use it in place of syscall name orutilize SYSCALL keyword.
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	#define mysyscall -1	POLICY my_const {  ALLOW {  }POLICY my_literal {  ALLOW {  }
google-readmegoogle-kafel.md	Argument filtering	Boolean expressions are used to filter syscalls based on their arguments.A expression resembles C language syntax, except that there are noarithmetic operators.their regular names as specified in Linux kernel and man pages.taken when no rule matches.

google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Quick Links	Developers can choose impropercipher modes, use obsolete algorithms, compose primitives in an unsafemanner, or fail to anticipate the need for key rotation
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Quick Links	Keyczarabstracts some of these details by choosing safe defaults,automatically tagging outputs with key version information, andproviding a simple programming interface.Keyczar is designed to be open, extensible, and cross-platformcompatible
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Quick Links	It is not intended to replace existing cryptographiclibraries like OpenSSL, PyCrypto, or the Java JCE, and in fact isbuilt on these libraries.
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	An illustrative use case	Suppose an application needs to encrypt a URL parameter value with asymmetric key
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	An illustrative use case	Normally, a developer would need to decide whichalgorithm to use, the key length to use, the mode of operation, how tohandle initialization vectors, how to rotate keys, and how to signciphertexts
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	An illustrative use case	Keyczar simplifies these choices
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	An illustrative use case	Using an existingkeyset, a Java developer would need to call the following:Interested in getting involved? We encourage open source developers tocontribute to the Keyczar project
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	An illustrative use case	Please join us on the Keyczarproject and subscribe to the Keyczar discussion group.
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Known Security Issues	The following section lists known security issues.There are probably others that have not been identified.
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Use of SHA 1 and 1024 bit DSA	Keyczar uses 1024 bit DSA keys with SHABoth of these are considered weak bycurrent security standards
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Use of SHA 1 and 1024 bit DSA	 However, it is not trivial to upgrade without breakingbackwards compatibility.
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Signed Session Encryption Re-signing	Keyczar signed session encryption does not include the key ID of the signing key insidethe encrypted plaintext
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	Signed Session Encryption Re-signing	This makes it possible for an attacker to strip the signaturefrom a message, and re-sign it using their private key, making it look like they sentthe original message.
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	DSA Signature Malleability	DSA signatures are basically two variable length ints
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	DSA Signature Malleability	So some DSA signatures are shorterthan others.There was a bug in KeyCzar  fixed here which essentially padded  right padding with 0  all DSA signatures to their maximum length.Some crypto libraries after finding both ints, which means that they will verify signature that have extradata
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	DSA Signature Malleability	This is why keyczar did not discover the extra data in DSA signatures.However, this can be a problem for specific crypto applications that compute fingerprintsof data that includes a message and its signature
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	DSA Signature Malleability	See the CVN  OpenSSL's comments and  problem  and this causes for BitCoint.Some new JCE implementations are more strict data
google-readmegoogle-keyczar.md	DSA Signature Malleability	In order for older  improperly padded DSA signatures  to be acceptible even whenrunning KeyCzar on such new JCE implementations trims any extra data from the signature.Note that this means you should not use this implementation for such applications bitcoin As other underlying crypto libraries make this strict implementations may have this issue.
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Keystone	Keystone is an architectural analysis toolset integrated in the Atom texteditor
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Keystone	It allows software engineers to create models of system architectureswhich can be used to guide development decisions through analysis andsimulation
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Keystone	The modelling and simulation capabilities are inspired by Palladio,a powerful analysis tool integrated into Eclipse, but with models represented ina plain text language
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Keystone	This yields some compelling benefits over the binary blob+ Models can be checked into version control+ A common on-disk format enables integration with other tools, including designrules checkers+ Human-readable text can be viewed and considered without special tooling+ Support for multiple formats can be added; Keystone currently supports modelsembedded in Markdown files
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Building	To build the project, follow these steps:Install the latest  Atom  release for your system.Clone the repository.Install the Elm toolset: npm install -g elm elm-testRun the build script: ./build.shLink Keystone to your Atom packages directory: apm link keystoneStart Atom in developer mode with atom -d or View > Developer > Open InDev ModeKeystone uses Elm, a strongly-typed functional language, for the bulk of itslogic
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Building	You will need to recompile the project before your changes to any .elmfiles will be visible in Atom
google-readmegoogle-keystone.md	Building	Generally, the edit flow goes something likeMake a change to an Elm file.Run ./build.sh, and fix any compile or test failures.Reload Atom  Alt+Ctrl+R on Linux, Cmd+Option+Ctrl+L on OSX, or View >Developer > Reload Window anywhere .Test the change in Atom.

google-readmegoogle-kiwi-solver.md	Kiwi-Solver	Kiwi is a minimalist and extendable Constraint Programming  CP  solver specifically designed for education
google-readmegoogle-kiwi-solver.md	Kiwi-Solver	The particularities of Kiwi stand in its generic trailing state restoration mechanism, its propagator-based propagation algorithm, and its modulable use of variables and heuristics
google-readmegoogle-kiwi-solver.md	Kiwi-Solver	By developing Kiwi, the author does not aim to create an alternative to full-featured constraint solvers but rather to provide readers with a basic architecture that will  hopefully  help them to understand the core mechanisms hidden under the hood of constraint solvers, to develop their own extended constraint solver, or to test innovative ideas.
google-readmegoogle-kiwi-solver.md	Disclaimer	This repository contains a Java version of Kiwi — the  first version of Kiwi  was implemented in Scala by rhartert during his PhD
google-readmegoogle-kiwi-solver.md	Disclaimer	The original source code of Kiwi was the result of rethinking and simplifying the architecture of the open-source  OscaR  solver to achieve what the author believes to be a good trade-off between performance, clarity, and conciseness.

google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	About the benchmark	The Web Latency Benchmark is a new kind of benchmark that tests your browser's responsiveness by directly measuring *latencyThe  Oculus Latency Tester  is a hardware device with a light sensor that can measure end-to-end latency from USB input to pixels changing on the screen
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	About the benchmark	This kind of hardware-based measurement accounts for all possible sources of latency
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	About the benchmark	It's the most complete and accurate measurement possible, and it's now supported by the Web Latency Benchmark
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	About the benchmark	Just plug it in and you'll see a special test page.
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	New: Automated testing	Thanks to jmaher, the benchmark now accepts command-line arguments that enable fully automated benchmark runs, with results reported in JSON format to a server of your choosing.
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	The Web Latency Benchmark works by programmatically sending input events to a browser window, and using screenshot APIs to detect when the browser has finished drawing its response.There are two main components: the latency-benchmark server  written in C/C++  and the HTML/JavaScript benchmark page
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	The HTML page draws a special pattern of pixels to the screen using WebGL or Canvas 2D, then makes an XMLHTTPRequest to the server to start the latency measurement
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	The server locates the browser window by searching a screenshot for the special pattern
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	Once the browser window is located, the server starts sending input events
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	Each time the HTML page receives an input event it encodes that information into pixels in the on-screen pattern, drawn using the canvas element
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	Meanwhile the server is taking screenshots every few milliseconds
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	By decoding the pixel pattern the server can determine to within a few milliseconds how long it takes the browser to respond to each input event.The native reference test is special because it requires extra support from the server
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	Using the native APIs of each platform, the server creates a special benchmark window that draws the same pattern as the test webpage, and responds to keyboard input in the same way
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	To ensure fairness when compared with the browser, this window is opened in a separate process and uses OpenGL to draw the pattern on the screen
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	How it works	The benchmark window opens as a popup window, only 1 pixel tall and without a border or title bar, so it's almost unnoticeable.
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	License and distribution	The Web Latency Benchmark is licensed under the Apache License version 2.This is an open source project; it is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	Build prerequisites	Python 2.x is required on all platforms for GYP, which generates the build files.First, you need to git submodule init && git submodule update to fetch the submodules in third_party
google-readmegoogle-latency-benchmark.md	Build prerequisites	Then, you need to run generate-project-files, which will run GYP and generate platform-specific project files in build/.

google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Performance	Here is a performance report  with explanations  from the run of theincluded db_bench program
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Performance	 The results are somewhat noisy, but shouldbe enough to get a ballpark performance estimate.
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Setup	We use a database with a million entries
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Setup	 Each entry has a 16 bytekey, and a 100 byte value
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Setup	 Values used by the benchmark compress toabout half their original size.
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Write performance	The "fill" benchmarks create a brand new database, in eithersequential, or random order
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Write performance	 The "fillsync" benchmark flushes datafrom the operating system to the disk after every operation; the otherwrite operations leave the data sitting in the operating system buffercache for a while
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Write performance	 The "overwrite" benchmark does random writes thatupdate existing keys in the database.Each "op" above corresponds to a write of a single key/value pair.I.e., a random write benchmark goes at approximately 400,000 writes per second.Each "fillsync" operation costs much less  0.3 millisecond than a disk seek  typically 10 milliseconds 
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Write performance	 We suspect that this isbecause the hard disk itself is buffering the update in its memory andresponding before the data has been written to the platter
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Write performance	 This mayor may not be safe based on whether or not the hard disk has enoughpower to save its memory in the event of a power failure.
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Read performance	We list the performance of reading sequentially in both the forwardand reverse direction, and also the performance of a random lookup.Note that the database created by the benchmark is quite small.Therefore the report characterizes the performance of leveldb when theworking set fits in memory
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Read performance	 The cost of reading a piece of data thatis not present in the operating system buffer cache will be dominatedby the one or two disk seeks needed to fetch the data from disk.Write performance will be mostly unaffected by whether or not theworking set fits in memory.LevelDB compacts its underlying storage data in the background toimprove read performance
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Read performance	 The results listed above were doneimmediately after a lot of random writes
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Read performance	 The results aftercompactions  which are usually triggered automatically  are better.Some of the high cost of reads comes from repeated decompression of blocksread from disk
google-readmegoogle-leveldb.md	Read performance	 If we supply enough cache to the leveldb so it can hold theuncompressed blocks in memory, the read performance improves again:

google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Overview	Caches passwords from other PAM modules and bypasses those modules based on aconfigurable policy.Why use libpam-policycache?
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Example	Built with autotools and includes an autogen.sh script:./autogen.sh  not needed when using source tarball makemake checksudo make install
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	TODO	In the following example policy, user "janedoe" may be the owner of the machineand her login experience is similar to having a password in /etc/shadow
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	TODO	Herpassword only needs to be checked by another module once a year.Others in the "users" group may also use the cache, but only for a short time.Their entries are evicted from the cache after an hour without use or two dayswithout being verified again using another module.
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	/etc/libpam-policycache.d/foo.policy	 user:janedoe expire=52w group:users refresh=1hexpire=2d
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Cache Storage	Policy entries are stored in /var/cache/libpam-policycache by default
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Cache Storage	Eachentry is stored in a file for the user it belongs to.The cache entry format is human-readable for easier debugging:Applications like screensavers that try to use the cache directly will bedenied, since the cache directory is only usable by root
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Cache Storage	Those applicationsshould use pam_escalate.so instead, which proxies the authentication prompt s through a pipe to a setuid-root helper called pam-escalate-helper
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Cache Storage	The helpercalls pam_start   and pam_authenticate   just like an application would, andit always uses /etc/pam.d/escalate for the service configuration
google-readmegoogle-libpam-policycache.md	Cache Storage	It checks inadvance that the user calling it is the same user as the one who should beauthenticated so it doesn't work for cases like web oder mail servers who checksystem users.The escalate module clears all environment variables, ignores some PAM items,and only implements pam_sm_authenticate   so it may not cover all use cases.At some point before or during the 1.0 release, the escalate module will bemoved to its own project.
google-readmegoogle-libprotobuf-mutator.md	Overview	libprotobuf-mutator is a library to randomly mutate protobuffers  It could be used together with guidedfuzzing engines, such as  libFuzzer 
google-readmegoogle-libprotobuf-mutator.md	Quick start on Debian/Ubuntu	Install prerequisites:By default, the system-installed version of protobuf  is used
google-readmegoogle-libprotobuf-mutator.md	Quick start on Debian/Ubuntu	 However, on somesystems, the system version is too old
google-readmegoogle-libprotobuf-mutator.md	Quick start on Debian/Ubuntu	 You can passLIB_PROTO_MUTATOR_DOWNLOAD_PROTOBUF=ON to cmake to automatically download andbuild a working version of protobuf.
google-readmegoogle-libprotobuf-mutator.md	Usage	To use libprotobuf-mutator simply include mutator.h  /src/mutator.h  and mutator.cc  /src/mutator.cc  into your build files.The ProtobufMutator class implements mutations of the protobuftree structure and mutations of individual fields.The field mutation logic is very basic -methods with more sophisticated logic, e.g.using  libFuzzer  mutators.To apply one mutation to a protobuf object do the following: mutator_test.cc  /src/mutator_test.cc .

google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Introduction	The license classifier is a library and set of tools that can analyze text todetermine what type of license it contains
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Introduction	It searches for license texts in afile and compares them to an archive of known licenses
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Introduction	These files could be,e.g., LICENSE files with a single or multiple licenses in it, or source codefiles with the license text in a comment.A "confidence level" is associated with each result indicating how close thematch was
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Introduction	A confidence level of 1.0 indicates an exact match, while aconfidence level of 0.0 indicates that no license was able to match the text.
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Adding a new license	Adding a new license is straight-forward: Create a file in licenses/
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Adding a new license	Add the license name to the list in license_type.go
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Adding a new license	Regenerate the licenses.db file by running the license serializer: Create and run appropriate tests to verify that the license is indeed
google-readmegoogle-licenseclassifier.md	Identify license	identify_license is a command line tool that can identify the license s within a file.The license_serializer tool regenerates the licenses.db archive

google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Note	We have been collaborating with  Docker  over libcontainer and are in process of porting the core lmctfy concepts and abstractions to  libcontainer  We are not actively developing lmctfy further and have moved our efforts to libcontainer
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Note	In future, we hope to replace the core of lmctfy with libcontainer.
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Introduction	lmctfy  pronounced *l-m-c-t-fi*, IPA: /ɛlɛmsitifаɪ/  is the open source version of  Google ’s container stack, which provides Linux application containers
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Introduction	These containers allow for the isolation of resources used by multiple applications running on a single machine
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Introduction	This gives the applications the impression of running exclusively on a machine
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Introduction	The applications may be container-aware and thus be able to create and manage their own subcontainers.The project aims to provide the container abstraction through a high-level API built around user intent
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Introduction	The containers created are themselves container-aware within the hierarchy and can be delegated to be managed by other user agents.lmctfy was designed and implemented with specific use-cases and configurations in mind and may not work out of the box for all use-cases and configurations
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Introduction	We do aim to support more use-cases and configurations so please feel free to  contribute  #contributing  patches or send e-mail to the  mailing list  #mailing-list  so that we may incorporate these into the  roadmap  #roadmap .lmctfy is released as both a C++ library and a CLI.
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Current Status	lmctfy is currently stalled as we migrate the core concepts to libcontainer and build a standard container management library that can be used by many projects.lmctfy is beta software and may change as it evolves
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Current Status	The latest release version is 0.5.0
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Current Status	It currently provides isolation for CPU, memory, and devices
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Current Status	It also allows for the creation of Virtual Hosts which are more heavily isolated containers giving the impression of running as an independent host
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Getting Started	This section describes building the CLI, running all unit tests, and initializing the machine
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Getting Started	The  CLI Commands  #cli-commands  section provides some examples of CLI operations and  C++ Library  #c-library  describes the use of the underlying library.
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Dependencies	lmctfy depends on the following libraries and expects them to be available on the system:
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Building the CLI	To build the lmctfy CLI:
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Building the C++ Library	To build the lmctfy library:
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Running Unit Tests	To build and run all unit tests:lmctfy has been tested on **Ubuntu 12.04+*In order to run lmctfy we must first initialize the machine
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Running Unit Tests	This only needs to happen once and is typically done when the machine first boots
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Running Unit Tests	If the cgroup hierarchies are already mounted, then an empty config is enough and lmctfy will auto-detect the existing mounts:
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Container Names	Container names mimic filesystem paths closely since they express a hierarchy of containers  i.e.: containers can be inside other containers, these are called **subcontainers*Allowable characters for container names are:
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Create	To create a container run:Example  create a memory-only container with 100MB limit :To destroy a container run:To list all containers in a machine, ask to recursively list from root:To run a command inside a container run:Use lmctfy help to see the full command listing and documentation.
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	C++ Library	The library is comprised of the ::containers::lmctfy::ContainerApi factory which creates, gets, destroys, and detects ::containers::lmctfy::Container objects that can be used to interact with individual containers
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	C++ Library	Full documentation for the lmctfy C++ library can be found in  lmctfy.h  /include/lmctfy.h 
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	The lmctfy project proposes a containers stack with two major layers we’ll call CL1 and CLCL1 encompases the driver and enforcement of the containers policy set by CLCL1 will create and maintain the container abstraction for higher layers
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	It should be the only layer that directly interacts with the kernel to manage containers
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	CL2 is what develops and sets container policy, it uses CL1 to enforce the policy and manage containers
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	For example: CL2  a daemon  implements a policy that the amount of CPU and memory used by all of a machine’s containers must not exceed the amount of available CPU and memory  as opposed to overcommitting memory in the machine 
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	To enforce that policy it uses CL1  library/CLI  to create containers with memory limits that add up to the machine’s available memory
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	Alternate policies may involve overcommitting a machine’s resources by X% or creating levels of resources with different guarantees for quality of service.The lmctfy project currently provides the CL1 component
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Roadmap	The CL2 is not yet implemented.
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	CL1	Currently only provides robust CPU and memory isolation
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	CL1	 In our roadmap we have support for the following:The most basic CL2 would use a container policy that ensures the fair sharing of a machine’s resources without allowing overcommitment
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	CL1	We aim to eventually implement a CL2 that provides different levels of guaranteed quality of service
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	CL1	In this scheme some levels are given stronger quality of service than others
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	CL1	The following CL2 features are supported in our roadmap:
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	lmctfy was originally designed and implemented around a custom kernel with a set of patches on top of a vanilla Linux kernel
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	As such, some features work best in conjunction with those kernel patches
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	However, lmctfy should work without them
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	It should detect available kernel support and adapt accordingly
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	We’ve tested lmctfy in vanilla **Ubuntu 3.3**Some of the relevant kernel patches:Interested in contributing to the project? Feel free to send a patch or take a look at our  roadmap  #roadmap  for ideas on areas of contribution
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	Follow  Getting Started  #getting-started  above and it should get you up and running
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	If not, let us know so we can help and improve the instructions
google-readmegoogle-lmctfy.md	Kernel Support	There is some documentation on the structure of lmctfy in the  primer  /PRIMER.md .

google-readmegoogle-macops-keychainminder.md	Keychain Minder	 this doesn'thappen
google-readmegoogle-macops-keychainminder.md	Keychain Minder	Instead, OS X has a built-in mechanism that appears after authenticatingat the login window to prompt users to update their keychain passwords but manyusers don't know what a keychain is, don't understand the dialog or haveforgotten their password.Keychain Minder re-creates this built-in mechanism but does so for screensaverand preference pane unlock instead of login

google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	Mail Importer for Gmail	Do you have an old Thunderbird mail archive that you POP3ed down from AOL?Do you want to move those old messages to Gmail so that you can use the Gmailapp on your phone and still have access to everything?If so, maybe _Mail Importer for Gmail_ is for you!If you are trying to bulk import mbox format files to Google Apps for Work,you should probably look at import-mailbox-to-gmail **DISCLAIMER**: This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	What does it do?	_Mail Importer for Gmail_ will upload the contents of a Thunderbird mailarchive to Gmail and do its best to preserve the read state, flagged state, andfolders of the messages
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	What does it do?	As messages are uploaded verbatim, Gmail will have anexact copy, including all attachments and headers._Mail Importer_ also makes sure to only upload messages that aren't already inGmail
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	What does it do?	This makes it easy to re-run the import multiple times if something goes
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	How can I run it?	Currently, _Mail Importer for Gmail_ is in early development
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	How can I run it?	It is __not__user friendly in any way
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	How can I run it?	If you are not a developer, you probably want tostay away.
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	Getting a Client Secret	Each developer needs a _client secret_ to identify their version of MailImporter to Google using OAuth2  To get aclient secret, you have to create a project in the Google Developers Console configure it correctly, then download the generated credentials
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	Getting a Client Secret	The resultshould be a JSON file named something like:Importer project
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	Getting a Client Secret	_**Never check in this file!**_ It is _your_ key and no one
google-readmegoogle-mail-importer.md	Building Mail Importer	Mail Importer uses  Maven  This means that it willdownload all of the necessary dependencies automatically when you build it like

google-readmegoogle-marmot.md	One line summary	Marmot is a service for processing workflows targeting DevOps/SRE needs
google-readmegoogle-marmot.md	The long summary	Marmot is a GRPC service that executes workflow descriptions againstinfrastructure  network devices, servers, kubernetes pods, ..
google-readmegoogle-marmot.md	The long summary	.This allows top level services/scripts to simply test the output for the correctworkflow descriptors instead of complex mocking, concurrency checks, ...This in turn provides code reuse and reduces code duplication
google-readmegoogle-marmot.md	The long summary	It also providessafety by having a single system responsible for execution and not hundreds ofMamort provides:Marmot is based on an internal Google project which processes tens of thousandsof workflows per week for several internal SRE/DevOps organizations.
google-readmegoogle-marmot.md	Use cases	Marmot has been designed as a DevOps/SRE tool for handlinginfrastructure changes, though it is not limited to this role
google-readmegoogle-marmot.md	Use cases	 Marmot is wellsuited for any type of operation that must be performed in steps with certainpacing and may require state checks for health.Examples include:This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Martian Proxy   	Martian Proxy is a programmable HTTP proxy designed to be used for testing.Martian is a great tool to use if you want to:anywhere that Go can target.
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Requirements	Go 1.9
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Installation	Martian Proxy can be installed using go install
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Start the Proxy	Assuming you've installed Martian, running the proxy is as simple asIf you want to see system logs as Martian is running, pass in the verbosityBy default, Martian will be running on port 8080, and the Martian API will be running on 8181
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Start the Proxy	The port can be specified via flags:
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Logging	For logging of requests and responses a  loggingmodifier  isavailable or  HAR  logs areavailable if the -har flag is used.
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	HAR Logging	To enable HAR logging in Martian call the binary with the -har flag:If the -har flag has been enabled two HAR related endpoints will beWill retrieve the HAR log of all requests and responses seen by the proxy sincethe last reset.Will reset the in-memory HAR log
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	HAR Logging	Note that the log will grow unbounded unlessit is periodically reset.
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Configure	Once Martian is running, you need to configure its behavior
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Configure	Withoutconfiguration, Martian is just proxying without doing anything to the requestsor responses
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Configure	If enabled, logging will take place without additionalMartian is configured by JSON messages sent over HTTP that take the generalform of:The above configuration tells Martian to inject a header with the name"Test-Header" and the value "true" on all responses.Let's break down the parts of this message
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Configure	 sets headers  to learn more about the header.Modifier, please  refer to the  modifier reference   "response", or both.This is a simple configuration, for more complex configurations, modifiers arecombined with groups and filters to compose the desired behavior.To configure Martian, POST the JSON to 
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Configure	You'llwant to use whatever mechanism your language of choice provides you to makeHTTP requests, but for demo purposes, curl works  assuming your configurationis in a file called modifier.json .
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Intercepting HTTPS Requests and Responses	Martian supports modifying HTTPS requests and responses if configured to do so.In order for Martian to intercept HTTPS traffic a custom CA certificate must beinstalled in the browser so that connection warnings are not shown.The easiest way to install the CA certificate is to start the proxy with thenecessary flags to use a custom CA certificate and private key using the -certand -key flags, or to have the proxy generate one using the -generate-ca-certAfter the proxy has started, visit  in thebrowser configured to use the proxy and a prompt will be displayed to installthe certificate.Several flags are available in examples/main.go to help configure MITM
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Check Verifiers	Let's assume that you've configured Martian to verify the presence a specificheader in responses to a specific URL.Here's a configuration to verify that all requests to example.com returnresponses with a 200 OK.Once Martian is running, configured and the requests and resultant responses youwish to verify have taken place, you can verify your expectation that you onlygot back 200 OK responses.To check verifications, performFailed expectations are tracked as errors, and the list of errors are retrievedby making a GET request to host:port/martian/verify, which will returna list of errors:Verification errors are held in memory until they are explicitly cleared by
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Martian as a Library	Martian can also be included into any Go program and used as a library.
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Modifiers All The Way Down	Martian's request and response modification system is designed to be generaland extensible
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Modifiers All The Way Down	The design objective is to provide individual modifierbehaviors that can arranged to build out nearly any desired modification.When working with Martian to compose behaviors, you'll need to be familiar withthese different types of interactions:Modifiers, filters and groups all implement ResponseModifier or RequestResponseModifier  defined in martian.go ModifyRequest req *http.Request  errorModifyResponse res *http.Response  errorThroughout the code  and this documentation  you'll see the word "modifier"used as a term that encompasses modifiers, groups and filters
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Modifiers All The Way Down	Even though agroup does not modify a request or response, we still refer to it as aWe refer to anything that implements the modifier interface as a Modifier.
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Parser Registration	Each modifier must register its own parser with Martian
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Parser Registration	The parser isresponsible for parsing a JSON message into a Go struct that implements amodifier interface.Martian holds modifier parsers as a map of strings to functions that is builtout at run-time
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Parser Registration	Each modifier is responsible for registering its parser with acall to parse.Register in init  .Signature of parse.Register:the same as the value of name in the JSON configuration message.In the following configuration message, header.Modifier is how the headermodifier is registered in the init   of header_modifier.go.Example of parser registration from header_modifier.go:func init   {  parse.Register "header.Modifier", modifierFromJSON func modifierFromJSON b   byte   interface{}, error  {  ...
google-readmegoogle-martian.md	Adding Your Own Modifier	If you have a use-case in mind that we have not developed modifiers, filters orverifiers for, you can easily extend Martian to your very specific needs.There are 2 mandatory parts of a modifier:

google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Minions	  
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	TL;DR	Minions is a filesystem-based, microservice oriented security scanner.It supports distributed security checks and isolates testing anddata access via  gRPC  can be *easily! High level schema of Minions 
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Status	We are actively opensourcing existing code and building new one, but the project is yet to hit the first full release  0.1 .Full roadmap  here  roadmap.md .
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Why does this project matter	Unlike traditional on-host security scanners, Minions minimizes the amount of code that needs to be executed on the target, and it's very easy to implement a new Goblin for a specific environment
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Why does this project matter	All the complex logic is in the Minions, and users can maintain control of what goes where by running their own Goblin and Overlord.Minions  scanners  also easily supports non-public scanners: adding a new tester using custom technology is as easy as implementing a well defined gRPC API.Minions is not thought to be a full end to end solution on its own: there is no fancy UI, nor dashboards
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Why does this project matter	It will,however, generate accurate findings that you can ingest in any other system, quickly and at scale
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Why does this project matter	It's likely mostuseful if you run a large infrastructure.
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Getting started	You can try the project by running everything on your local box.Install the latest version of  bazel  There are handy packages for most platforms.Check out the project.Run the backend scanning services locally via the execute_local.sh bash script.Scan your local machine by running, in the src directoryMuch like ancient Gaul, a Minions infrastructure is divided in three main components: the Goblins, the Overlord and the Minions.A **Goblin*A **Minion*Finally, the **Overlord*
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Interests	Separating data-gathering and actual testing of the data seems like a good idea on paper, but in practice has  at least  two main problems:  standard location might point to another configuration file in some directory hidden in a dark corner of the disk.Minions solves this problem with the use of *Interests*
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Interests	An interest is a way for a Minion to tell a Goblin what it cares about at a given moment
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Interests	All Minion instances start with a set of initial Interests they always care about, but the list is iteratively updated as they process files they have ingested.THe way this works in practice is that every time a Goblin sends files to an Overlord, it waits until the backend Minions have processed it and can be served back a new list of files to provide 
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Building and running	Minions is a set of microservices
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Building and running	You'll have to run at least 2 components to get aything useful: an Overlord, and one or more Minions.
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Minion	Start by running one or more Minions Each Minion carries its own set of flags and configs, but all need to be pointed to have the Overlord pointed at them, so they should be the first thing to start up.Minion have a *runnerIf you run more than a single replica of a minion, and if a minion keeps state, you'll want to have a shared backend.TODO paradoxengine : explain how one can know and what to do : 
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Overlord	Once a minion is running, you can start the overlord, the orchestrator of the system.The Overlord expects to be told where its minions are
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Overlord	Today, this is done simply by specifying as a flag the address of said minions.The overlord will then register with them and get ready to serve data.Assuming you have a minion running on localhost port 20001  the default when you run one , you'd start the Overlord as follows.
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Minion details: Vulners	The Vulners minion parses package databases on Linux systems to identify the presence of outdated software that carries security vulnerabilities
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Minion details: Vulners	To do so it needs to parse the RPM backend Sadly, this means that building it is non hermetic, as the system will have to provide the rpm lib
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Minion details: Vulners	On Debian/Ubuntu system, that means you need to make sure you have the librpm-dev package installed to build it.
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Goblin	Once you have the address of an Overlord with a set of working Minions you can run a Goblin to feed data to it.The simplest Goblin available is the Local Goblin, which fetches files from the filesystem of the box it runs on
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Goblin	To run it, enter the main src directory and run the following:We warmly welcome contributions, in particular of additional detectors  which are hopefully fairly easy to write once you get the hang of the APIs 
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Goblin	Please read the  contributing  CONTRIBUTING.md  policy first.
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Build environment	Minions has been developed using  Bazel  an opensource build infrastructure by Google
google-readmegoogle-minions.md	Build environment	Bazel can compile multiple languages using a common idiom cross platform, which is a nice property to have for Minions.The Go code also builds and runs with the native compiler

google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	mtail 	 ! GoDoc      mtail is a tool for extracting metrics from application logs to be exportedinto a timeseries database or timeseries calculator for alerting andIt aims to fill a niche between applications that do not export their owninternal state, and existing monitoring systems, without patching thoseapplications or rewriting the same framework for custom extraction glue code.The extraction is controlled by  mtail programs  docs/Programming-Guide.md which define patterns and actions:Metrics are exported for scraping by a collector as JSON or Prometheus formatover HTTP, or can be periodically sent to a collectd, StatsD, or Graphitecollector socket.Read the  programming guide  docs/Programming-Guide.md  if you want to learn howto write mtail programs.Mailing list: 
google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	Installation	There are various ways of installing **mtail**.
google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	Precompiled binaries	Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the Releases page  on Github
google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	Precompiled binaries	Using thelatest production release binary is the recommended way of installing **mtail**.Windows, OSX and Linux binaries are available.
google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	Building from source	To build mtail from the source code yourself you need to have a working Goenvironment with version 1.9 or greater installed, also some additional toolslike goyacc
google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	Building from source	 You can't go get the software and have it build straight away.See the  Build instructions  docs/Building.md  for more details.A Dockerfile is included in this repository for local development as analternative to installing Go in your environment, and takes care of all thebuild dependency installation, if you don't care for that.
google-readmegoogle-mtail.md	Deployment	mtail works best when it paired with a timeseries-based calculator andalerting tool, like  Prometheus > So what you do is you take the metrics from the log files and> you bring them down to the monitoring system? It deals with the instrumentation so the engineers don't haveto!   It has theextraction skills!  It is good at dealing with log files!!
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	MµG	A small Java 8 utilities library   javadoc  with 0 deps
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	MµG	!  Add the following to pom.xml:
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 BiStream  streams pairs of objects.	This class closely mirrors Jdk Stream API  the few extra methods of "its own" are very straight-forward 
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 BiStream  streams pairs of objects.	If you are familiar with Jdk stream, learning curve is minimal.**Example 1: to iterate over a stream with indices:**A: Sometimes Foo and Bar are just an arbitrary pair of objects, with no key-value relationship
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 BiStream  streams pairs of objects.	Or you may not trust Foo#equals   and hashCode  
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 BiStream  streams pairs of objects.	Instead, drop-in replace your Stream>/List> with BiStream/BiCollection to get better readability.**Q: Why not Stream?**A: When you already have a proper domain object, sure
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 BiStream  streams pairs of objects.	But you might find it cumbersome to define a bunch of FooAndBar, PatioChairAndKitchenSink one-off classes.**Q: Why not Stream>?**A: It's distracting to read code littered with opaque method names like getFirst   and getSecond  
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 BiStream  streams pairs of objects.	It's also less efficient because you end up creating lots of temporary Pair objects.
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 MoreStreams 	**Example 1: to split a stream into smaller-size chunks  batches :**The Stream API provides forEach   to iterate over a stream, if you don't have to throw checked exceptions.When checked exception is in the way, or if you need control flow  continue, return etc
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 MoreStreams 	, iterateThrough   and iterateOnce   can help
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 MoreStreams 	The following code uses iterateThrough   to write objects into an ObjectOutputStream, with  IOException propagated:**Example 3: to generate a stream  that can be finite  iteratively:*// Returns next round of elements, or empty to stop generating.private Stream nextValues T currentValue  {  ...Stream stream = MoreStreams.generate seed, this::nextValues ;**Example 4: to merge maps:*interface Page {  Map getTrafficHistogram  ;List pages = ...;// Merge traffic histogram across all pages of the web siteMap siteTrafficHistogram = pages.stream  
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 Retryer 	Blocking the thread for retry isn't always a good idea at server side
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 Retryer 	It is however simple and being able to propagate exceptions directly up the call stack is convenient:
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To retry asynchronously	If getAccount   itself already runs asynchronously and returns CompletionStage, it can be retried using the retryAsync   method.And for demo purpose, let's use Fibonacci backoff strategy, with a bit of randomization in the backoff to avoid bursty traffic, why not?
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To retry based on return value	Sometimes the API you work with may return error codes instead of throwing exceptions
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To retry based on return value	Retries can be based on return values too:Or, use a predicate:
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Backoffs are just List	exponentialBackoff  , fibonacci  , timed   and randomized   are provided out of the box for convenience purpose only
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Backoffs are just List	But at the end of the day, backoffs are just old-school boring Lists
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Backoffs are just List	This makes the backoff strategies extensible
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Backoffs are just List	You can create the List in any way you are used to, using any Java library
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Backoffs are just List	For example, there isn't a uniformDelay   in this library, because there is already Collections.nCopies n, delay .Or, to concatenate two different backoff strategies together  first uniform and then exponential , the Java 8 Stream API has a good tool for the job:What about to retry infinitely? Collections.nCopies Integer.MAX_VALUE, delay  isn't infinite but close
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Backoffs are just List	JDK only uses O 1  time and space for creating it; same goes for Delay#exponentialBackoff   and Delay#fibonacci  .
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To handle retry events	Sometimes the program may need custom handling of retry events, like, for example, to increment a stats counter based on the error code in the exception
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To handle retry events	Requirements like this can be done with a custom Delay implementation:class RpcDelay extends Delay {  }  }  }return new Retryer  Or, to get access to the retry attempt number, which is also the list's index, here's an example:class RpcDelay extends Delay {  RpcDelay int attempt, Duration duration  {...}  }List> delays = Delay.ofMillis 10 .fibonacci ..
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To handle retry events	;return new Retryer  
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To keep track of exceptions	If the method succeeds after retry, the exceptions are by default logged
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	To keep track of exceptions	As shown above, one can override beforeDelay   and afterDelay   to change or suppress the loggging.If the method fails after retry, the exceptions can also be accessed programmatically through exception.getSuppressed  .
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 Maybe 	Represents a value that may have failed with an exception.Tunnels checked exceptions through streams or futures.
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Streams	For a stream operation that would have looked like this if checked exception weren't in the way:import static com.google.mu.util.Maybe.byValue;import static com.google.mu.util.Maybe.maybe;Stream> stream = files.stream  List contents = new ArrayList<>  ;Iterate.through stream, m -> contents.add m.orElseThrow    ;return contents;
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Futures	In asynchronous programming, checked exceptions are wrapped inside ExecutionException or CompletionException
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Futures	By the time the caller catches it, the static type of the causal exception is already lost
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Futures	The caller code usually resorts to instanceof MyException
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Futures	For example, the following code recovers from AuthenticationException:
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	The problem	The following code converts a list of objects:Now assume the input can be of two different kinds, with one kind to be converted through a remote service
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	The problem	Like this:Perhaps this?Tl;Dr: maintaining the encounter order while dispatching objects to batches requires careful juggling of the indices and messes up the code rather quickly.
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	The tool	Funnel is a simple class designed for this use case:That is, define the batches with funnel.through   and then inputs can flow through arbitrary number of batch conversions
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	The tool	Conversion results flow out of the funnel in the same order as inputs entered the funnel
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	 Parallelizer 	Runs a  large  pipeline of tasks in parallel while limiting the number of in-flight tasks.For example, the following snippet uploads a large number of pictures in parallel:Note that this code will terminate if any picture fails to upload

google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Why not parallel stream?	Some major shopping-list differences:Again, use case is different:The thread pool queues all pending tasks
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Why not parallel stream?	If the input stream is too large to fit in memory, you'll get an OutOfMemoryError.Exceptions  including NullPointerException, OutOfMemoryError  are silently swallowed  but may print stack trace 
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Why not parallel stream?	To propagate the exceptions, the Future objects need to be stored in a list and then Future#get   needs to be called on every future object after all tasks have been submitted to the executor.Tasks submitted to an executor are independent
google-readmegoogle-mug.md	Why not parallel stream?	One task failing doesn't automatically terminate the pipeline.

google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	The "Program", below, refers to any such program orwork, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or anyderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing theProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/ortranslated into another language
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	 Hereinafter, translation is included withoutlimitation in the term "modification"

google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	The act of running the Program is notrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contentsconstitute a work based on the Program  independent of having been made byrunning the Program 
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code asyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriatelypublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this Licensealong with the Program.You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may atyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thusforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modificationsor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all ofthese conditions:you changed the files and the date of any change.in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to belicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of thisyou must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the mostordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriatecopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty  or else, saying thatyou provide a warranty  and that users may redistribute the program under theseconditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	 Exception:if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such anannouncement, your work based on the Program is not required to print anannouncement
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	If identifiablesections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonablyconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, andits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is awork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest yourrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise theright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on theIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with theProgram  or with a work based on the Program  on a volume of a storage ordistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.You may copy and distribute the Program  or a work based on it, under Section2  in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 aboveprovided that you also do one of the following:code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange; or,give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physicallyperforming source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of thecorresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,distribute corresponding source code
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	 This alternative is allowed only fornoncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object codeor executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for makingmodifications to it
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	For an executable work, complete source code means all thesource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interfacedefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installationof the executable
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	However, as a special exception, the source code distributedneed not include anything that is normally distributed  in either source orbinary form  with the major components  compiler, kernel, and so on  of theoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itselfaccompanies the executable.If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source codefrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though thirdparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except asexpressly provided under this License
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminateyour rights under this License
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated solong as such parties remain in full compliance.You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Programor its derivative works
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	These actions are prohibited by law if you do notaccept this License
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program  or anywork based on the Program , you indicate your acceptance of this License to doso, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying theProgram or works based on it.Each time you redistribute the Program  or any work based on the Program ,the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor tocopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of therights granted herein
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by thirdparties to this License.If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringementor for any other reason  not limited to patent issues , conditions are imposedon you  whether by court order, agreement or otherwise  that contradict theconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of thisLicense
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously yourobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all thosewho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way youcould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely fromdistribution of the Program.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and thesection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents orother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; thissection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free softwaredistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	Manypeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of softwaredistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing todistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose thatThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be aconsequence of the rest of this License.If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certaincountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyrightholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicitgeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so thatdistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	In suchcase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of thisThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of theGeneral Public License from time to time
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	Such new versions will be similar inspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problemsor concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number
google-readmegoogle-mysql.md	Thanks to Daniel Blezek  for the GTEST_ADD_TESTS code	If the Program specifiesa version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that versionor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation

google-readmegoogle-n-digit-mnist.md	n-digit MNIST	MNIST handwritten digits have been arguably the most popular dataset for machine learning research.Although the state-of-the-art learned models have long ago reached possibly the best achievable performances on this benchmark,the dataset itself remains useful to the research community, providing a simple sanity check for new methods:if it doesn't work on MNIST, it doesn't work anywhere!We introduce n-digit variants of MNIST here
google-readmegoogle-n-digit-mnist.md	n-digit MNIST	By adding more digits per data point, one can exponentially increase the number of classes for the dataset.Nonetheless, they still take advantage of the simpleness and light-weighted nature of data.These datasets provide a simple and useful toy examples for e.g
google-readmegoogle-n-digit-mnist.md	n-digit MNIST	face embedding.One can furthermore draw an analogy between individual digits and e.g

google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	ndprbrd 	Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product.This daemon has a very specific purpose: to give the same IPv6 prefix /64 toseveral network interfaces using radvd without creating L2 bridge and withoutneed to configure DHCPvIt's designed to be used together with ndppd  for case if ISP givessingle /64 without delegating a bigger prefix to your router.
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Deprecation notice	On 2017-08-07 this functionality  wasmerged  into ndppd itself.However, there are several caveats:An example ndppd config with this functionality enabled:
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	How to use ndprbrd	Below are 2 sample setups more complicated one which makes use of it
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	How to use ndprbrd	The simple setup sets the base forthe more complicated one.
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Setup with makes use of ndprbrd	tries to reach an address 2001:db8:1:2::But which of two LANs contain thisaddress? They both use the same prefix! Having route 2001:db8:1:2::/64 on botheth1 and eth2 won't work, as such routes will collide, and kernel will sendpackets to only one of interfaces.This is where ndprbrd comes to rescue
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Setup with makes use of ndprbrd	It has 2 modes, using TAP interface  therecommended mode , and not using it.and ndprbrd resends it to all interfaces which it's configured to use
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Setup with makes use of ndprbrd	Let'ssay LAN-1 replies with neighbor advertisement
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Setup with makes use of ndprbrd	Then ndprbrd sees it, and adds astatic route to the advertised address 2001:db8:1:2::33 to interface ethFromthis point all packets to that address will go directly to eth1, and not toeth2, and not even to ndprbrdIf at some point later advertisements about 2001:db8:1:2::33 stopped coming frometh1, the static route is removed after a timeout  10 minutes by default 
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Setup with makes use of ndprbrd	Then,if a new packet comes to that address, all LANs will be used to discover itOnly absence of traffic will trigger such timeout, because with traffic theneighbor solicitations are still sent from time to time
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Setup with makes use of ndprbrd	The solicitation willgo directly to eth1 because of the static route, the machine will reply, andndprbrd will see it and reset the timer.send something to LAN-2? The answer is ndppd again: instead of listening only oneth0 ndppd should listen also on eth1 and ethNote about firewall setup: forwarding from eth0 to ndprbrd0 should be accepted.Otherwise, kernel won't generate NDP solicitations to ndprbrd TODO: thisstatement is true for static configuration of ndppd on ethProbably autodoesn't require this, but I didn't check 
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	The mode without TAP interface  not recommended 	If Linux is compiled without TUN/TAP interface support, another mode isavailable
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	The mode without TAP interface  not recommended 	In this mode, ndprbrd every second switches the route to2001:db8:1:2::/64 from one interface to another
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	The mode without TAP interface  not recommended 	So when the neighborsolicitation is sent, there is a chance that it's sent to the correct LAN, inwhich case ndprbrd will see the neighbor advertisement, and add the route forthat address.Note that when an address is discovered in some LAN, due to the timeoutmechanism described above, that address will continue working until itdisappears from that LAN for 10 minutes
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	The mode without TAP interface  not recommended 	However, several first packets arelikely to be dropped
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	The mode without TAP interface  not recommended 	In TAP mode they are still likely to be dropped, butnumber of first packets dropped is smaller in TAP mode.
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Usage	./ndprbrd --interface=eth1 --interface=eth2 --prefix=2001:db8:1:2::/64To change name of TAP interface, use --tun=foo
google-readmegoogle-ndprbrd.md	Usage	To use the mode without TAPinterface, use --pendulum.Sample config of ndppd:Also note that routers don't usually accept RA themselves, so you might need tospecify the default route yourself  or try to set accept_ra to 2 .

google-readmegoogle-neper.md	neper	neper is a Linux networking performance tool.neper as a small code base with clean coding style and structure, and iseasy to extend with new workloads and/or new options
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	neper	 It can also be embeddedas a library in a larger application to generate epoll-based workloads.Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	neper is intended to be used between two machines
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 On each machine, theneper process  e.g
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	tcp_rr or tcp_stream  spawns T threads  workers ,creates F flows  e.g
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	TCP connections , and multiplexes the F flows evenly overthe T threads
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 Each thread has a epoll set to manage multiple flows
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 Eachflow keeps its own state to make sure the expected workload is generated.For ease of explanation, we refer to the two machines as the server and theclient
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 The server is the process which binds to an endpoint, while the clientis the process which connects to the server
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 The ordering of connect   invocations is insignificant, as neper ensures the two processesare synchronized properly.When launching the client process, we can specify the number of seconds togenerate network traffic
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 After that duration, the client will notify theserver to stop and exit
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 To run the test again, we have to restart both theclient and the server
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Basic usage	 This is different from netperf, and hopefully shouldmake individual tests more independent from each other.
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	tcp_rr options	The output is only available in the detailed form  samples.csv  but not inthe stdout summary.
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Output format	When consuming the key-value pairs in the output, the order of the keys shouldbe insignificant
google-readmegoogle-neper.md	Output format	 However, the keys are case sensitive.

google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	One of its differences from HTTP/1 is  *serverpush*  which allows aserver to pre-emptively send responses to a client in association with aprevious client-initiated request
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	This can be useful when the server knowsthe client will need to have those responses available in order to fullyprocess the response to the original request.It sounds simple and easy but is quite tricky for service developers tomanually figure out and configure what resources to push in association withanother resource
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	There are also many pitfalls the implementors must knowabout
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	See  Rules of Thumb for HTTP/2Push for the details.This project is for automating server push and getting rid of the need formanual configurations from service developers
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	It is meant as a helperlibrary for building middlewares for various  Node.js web servers, such as  Express  fastify  etc.This library assumes that the middlewares built on top of it act as a staticfile server
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	That is because static file serving is one of the most commonuse cases for HTTP/2 server push.See  for an example
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	HTTP/2 automatic server push	It is a fastify  plugin for supporting auto-push.**This package currently works only with Node >=9.4.0.**
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	Constructor	preprocessRequest interface PreprocessResult {  newCacheCookie: string;  pushFn:    => Promise;This method must be called for every request from the client
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	Constructor	It determineswhich other resources must be pushed, if any, in association with the currentrequest path
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	Constructor	It also checks whether any resources to be pushed are alreadycached in the browser side
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	Constructor	It is done by storing and reading the relatedinformation in a cookie value.Returns a promise for the result  pushFn to push static resources that are associated with the currentThis method  and index.html is a non-static file that is dynamically generated by theapplication, it probably wants to push related resources such as stylesheets,images, JavaScript files, etc

google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	recordRequestPath  	called for non-static file requests as well as static files, as explained forpreprocessRequest   above.
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	AssetCacheConfig	This can be passed to the constructor of AutoPush to customize the cachingThe time duration  in milliseconds  after a client request during which torecord additional requests
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	AssetCacheConfig	That record will be used for determining theassociated resources that may be pushed for a request path.
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	promotionRatio	If an additional request is frequently made for a certain original requestand its hit ratio is over the promotionRatio value, that request path isconsidered one of the associated resources of the original request, and it'llbe pushed when a request is made for the same original request path later.
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	demotionRatio	Similar to demotionRatio, the request path will not be considered an associatedresource anymore.
google-readmegoogle-node-h2-auto-push.md	minimumRequests	The minimum number of requests for a certain path before being considered asa candidate for an associated resource.

google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Nomulus	! Nomulus logo  ./nomulus-logo.png 
google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Overview	Nomulus is an open source, scalable, cloud-based service for operating top-level domains   TLDs 
google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Overview	Itis the authoritative source for the TLDs that it runs, meaning that it isresponsible for tracking domain name ownership and handling registrations,renewals, availability checks, and WHOIS requests
google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Overview	End-user registrants  i.e.people or companies that want to register a domain name  use an intermediatedomain name registrar acting on their behalf to interact with the registry.Nomulus runs on  Google App Engine  gae  and is written primarily in Java
google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Overview	It isthe software that  Google Registry  uses tooperate TLDs such as .google, .app, .how, .soy, and .みんな
google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Overview	It can run anynumber of TLDs in a single shared registry system using horizontal scaling
google-readmegoogle-nomulus.md	Overview	Itssource code is publicly available in this repository under the  Apache 2.0 freeand open source license

google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	Currently, the in-built bootloader supports only modern Linux kernels.It follows the Linux boot convention by setting the vcpu directly into 32-bitprotected mode and jumping to the ELF entry point
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	Or, if it finds a 64-bitkernel, it will do a bit of additional setup  creating an identity-mapped pagetable  and then jumps directly into 64-bit long mode at the entry point.For full details on this convention see:The embedded bootloader works different than traditional bootloaders, such asGRUB or LILO
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	Unlike other bootloaders, the embedded bootloader requires theELF kernel binary  vmlinux , not the compressed image  bzImage .This is because the compressed image  bzImage  contains a compressed version ofthe ELF kernel binary, real-mode setup code, and a small setup sector.Traditional bootloaders typically lay these components out in memory andexecute the real-mode code
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	The real-mode setup code will construct a few basicdata structures via BIOS calls, extract the vmlinux binary into memory andfinally jump into 32-bit protected mode in the newly uncompressed code.This is a sensible approach, as the real-mode kernel code will be able toexecute arbitrary BIOS calls and probe the hardware in arbitrary ways beforefinally switching to protected mode
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	However, for a virtualized environmentwhere the hardware is fixed and known to the hypervisor, the bootloader itselfcan lay out the necessary data structures in memory and start *directly32-bit protected mode
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	In addition to skipping a batch of real-mode executionand emulation, this allows us to avoid having to build a BIOS at all.If a bzImage is provided, the ELF binary will be extracted and cached using asimple script derived from the script found in the Linux tree.Given a vmlinux binary file, we load the file directly into memory as specifiedby the ELF program headers
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	For example:We also note the entry point for the binary  here it happens to be 0x1000000 .Before we are able to jump to the entry point, we need to setup some basicrequirements that would normally be done by the real-mode setup code:into memory
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Bootloader ###	This is pointed to as part of the boot parameters, anddecompression is handled by the kernel.
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Devices ###	The device model implemented by this kernel is substantially different frommost VMs
google-readmegoogle-novm.md	Devices ###	Instead of attemping to emulate a legacy machine, we instead tosupport only the mechanisms which make sense for a next generationpurpose-built Virtual Machine.

google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	OpenAPI Test Templates  oatts 	> Generate basic unit test scaffolding for your  OpenAPI specification 
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Disclaimer	This is not an officially supported Google product.oatts is based off of the  swagger-test-templates  module and the lessons learned during its development._This is a work in progress._
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Goal	The goal of oatts is to provide a standalone module for generating Node.js unit test code scaffolding based on a given OpenAPI specification.The hope is that by providing such a tool, API developers will be encouraged to test the contract between their spec and backend early, often and continuously as the project grows.
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Usage	There are a couple ways to use oatts.
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Module	Install via npmThen use it in codevar oatts = require 'oatts' ;var options = {var tests = oatts.generate '/path/to/openapi.yaml', options ;console.log tests 
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Command line interface	Install globally via npmThen use in your command line> oatts generate --help> oatts generate -s ./path/to/openapi.yaml -w ./output/dir> ls ./output/dirpet-test.js  pet-{petId}-uploadImage-test.js  user-test.js 
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Command line interface	.
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Using the result	The resulting test files are built using the  mocha  testing framework and  chakram  API testing framework
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Using the result	Thus, you will need both of these dependencies installed in order to run your newly generated tests.After installing these, you can run the tests with mocha:
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	start your API server to test against!!	> mocha --recursive 
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Custom Values	Custom values can be supplied through both the command line and a JSON file
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Custom Values	The in-line, command line supplied JSON will take precedent.An example custom values JSON file can be found  here  ./test/process/documents/customValuesTest.json .
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Custom Templates	Custom templates can be supplied via the templates option
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Custom Templates	The directory pointed to by the option must contain 4  Handlebars  templates named the same way as those found in ./templates.There are also a few helpers available to be used in the Handlebars templates, which can be found in the templateHelpers documentation namespace
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Custom Templates	Use the default templates as examples of how to use them.
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Options	The following options can be passed to the generation function, some/all are exposed in the accompanying CLI:| Name | CLI Flag | Default | Required | Description || ---| spec | --spec -s | n/a | true | Path to a swagger.yaml or openapi.yaml || host | --host | spec.host | false | Hostname to put in test requests; defaults to host in given spec || paths | --paths -p | spec.paths | false | API paths to generate tests for; defaults to all paths in given spec || samples | --samples -e | false | false | Toggle generating sample responses for assertion || writeTo | --writeTo -w | n/a | false | Directory to write generated tests to; will create the directory if it doesn't exist || consumes | --consumes -c | operation.consumes 0  &#124; &#124; spec.conumes 0  | false | Consumes header to use in a request when applicable | | produces | --produces -o | operation.produces 0  &#124; &#124; spec.produces 0  | false | Produces header to use in a request when applicable || customValues | --customValues -u | n/a | false | Values to be populated in requests where specified; overrides customValuesFile || customValuesFile | --customValuesFile | n/a | false | Path to a JSON file with values to populate in requests || scheme | --scheme -m | spec.schemes 0  | false | Override for multiple scheme present in a spec || templates | --templates -t | './templates' | false | Path to directory containing custom templates || statusCodes |--status-codes -S | operation.responses | false | comma separated list of status codes to explicity generate tests for |
google-readmegoogle-oatts.md	Testing	To test this module simply use the npm script

google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	Overview	oauth2l supports all Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flows for both useraccounts and service accounts in different environments:NOTE: oauth2l caches the OAuth credentials in user's home directory toavoid prompting user repeatedly.
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	--json	Specifies an OAuth credential file, either an OAuth client ID or a ServiceAccount key, to start the OAuth flow
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	--json	You can download the file from Google Cloud Console Using an external Single Sign-on  SSO  command to fetch OAuth token.The command outputs an OAuth access token to its stdout
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	--json	The defaultcommand is for Google's corporate SSO
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	--json	For example:When this option is set and the json file specified in the --json optionis a service account key file, a JWT token signed by the service accountprivate key will be generated
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	--json	When this option is set, no scope list isneeded but a single JWT audience must be provided
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	--json	See how to construct theaudience  here 
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	fetch	Fetch and print an access token for the specified OAuth scopes
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	fetch	For example,the following command prints access token for the following OAuth2 scopes:  "access_token": "ya29.zyxwvutsrqpnmolkjihgfedcba",  "token_expiry": "2017-02-27T21:20:47Z",  "user_agent": "oauth2l/1.0.0",  ...NOTE: the -f flag specifies the output format
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	fetch	The supported formats are:bare  default , header, json, json_compact, pretty.
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	header	The same as fetch, except the output is in HTTP header format:the following command uses the PubSub API to list all PubSub topics.shell alias for it
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	header	For example:Print information about a valid token
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	header	This always includes the list of scopesand expiration time
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	header	If the token has either the scope, it also prints the emailaddress of the authenticated identity.Test a token
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	header	This sets an exit code of 0 for a valid token and 1 otherwise,which can be useful in shell pipelines.Reset all tokens cached locally
google-readmegoogle-oauth2l.md	header	We cache previously retrieved tokens in thefile ~/.oauth2l.token.

google-readmegoogle-okay.md	okay: abstract cross-package auth nz 	okay is a package that allows consumers to pass authentication andauthorization checks across package boundaries.Consumers should start with the base OK, which denies everyone to everything,and add permissions as required with the Allow, Validate, and Verify
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	Often there is some resource to which we want to restrict access; databases  orcolumns, or rows , file systems, URL endpoints, or even specific functions orSay we have a file system type:package fsimport  	"io"	"os"	"path/filepath" type FileSystem struct {	Root stringfunc  fs FileSystem  Open path string   io.ReadCloser, error  {	return os.Open filepath.Join fs.Root, path  This could be used to e.g
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	serve the file via HTTP, but it provides no accesscontrols
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	 We could add this by modifying Open to take a Context which containsthe appropriate credentials:import  	"context"	"io"	"os"	"path/filepath" func  fs FileSystem  Open ctx context.Context, path string   io.ReadCloser, error  {	// TODO: check context somehow	return os.Open filepath.Join fs.Root, path  How should we check the context?  If we're serving this via HTTP, we couldprovide simple authentication by wrapping HTTP basic authentication into apackage serverimport  	"context"	"net/http" type authType stringfunc getContext r *http.Request  context.Context {	ctx := r.Context  	if user, pass, ok := r.BasicAuth  ; ok {		ctx = context.WithValue ctx, authType "user" , user 		ctx = context.WithValue ctx, authType "pass" , pass 	}	return ctxfunc handleRequest rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request  {	ctx := getContext r 	doTheThing ctx, rw ...and then providing a facility to verify that context:package serverimport "context"func  s *Server  Authenticate ctx context.Context   bool, error  {	user, ok := ctx.Value authType "user"  
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	string 	if !ok {		return false, nil	}	pass, ok := ctx.Value authType "pass"  
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	string 	if !ok {		return false, nil	}Now we know how to check the context and can successfully gate access to ourimport  	"context"	"fmt"	"io"	"os"	"path/filepath"	"server" type FileSystem struct {	Server server.Server	Root   stringfunc  fs *FileSystem  Open ctx context.Context, path string   io.ReadCloser, error  {	ok, err := fs.Server.Authenticate ctx 	if err != nil {		return nil, err	}	if !ok {		return nil, fmt.Errorf "%s: permission denied", path 	}	return os.Open filepath.Join fs.Root, path  Unfortunately, this very tightly couples packages fs and server
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	 If fswants to grant users via another scheme, such as OAuth2, or to certainadministrator users, or in some other way, all the methods which check forauthentication must be updated
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview	 It may be that server is not something wecan modify; it may be that fs isn't something we can modify.This can be fixed by having fs accept OK types:import  	"context"	"fmt"	"io"	"okay"	"os"	"path/filepath" type FileSystem struct {	Auths   okay.OK	Root  stringfunc  fs FileSystem  Open ctx context.Context, path string   io.ReadCloser, error  {	ok, err := okay.Check ctx, path, fs.Auths..
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Overview		if err != nil {		return nil, err	}	if !ok {		return nil, fmt.Errorf "%s: permission denied", path 	}	return os.Open filepath.Join fs.Root, path  Now FileSystem.Auths can be extended at will by fs or any consumer of fs, andit will gate the guarded resources appropriately.
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Use	Packages using okay should begin with the base type, and add authentication Verify   , authorization  Allows   , and validation  Valid    checks asThe base type is always valid, and authenticates nobody and authorizes nothing.
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Validation	OKs are valid until they are not, and are thereafter never valid
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Validation	 If aconsumer wishes to create an access grant that expires  for example, to allowaccess to a file for only 24 hours , they should do so by creating an OK thatexpires after that period of time
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Validation	 The okay package has several helperfunctions for this:their own validation functions:import  	"os"	"os/signal"	"sync/atomic"	"okay" func SigintCancel   OK {	ch := make chan os.Signal, 1 	signal.Notify ch, os.Interrupt 	var v int32	go func   {		<-ch		atomic.StoreInt32 &v, 1 	}  	ok := okay.New  	ok = okay.Validate ok, func   bool {		return atomic.LoadInt32 &v  == 0	} 	return ok
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Authentication	Consumers are expected to provide custom authentication with the Verify  Here is a simple package that provides token-based authentication:package authtokenimport  	"context"	"okay" type authToken struct{}// WithToken returns a context that contains the given auth token.func WithToken ctx context.Context, token string  context.Context {	return context.WithValue ctx, authToken{}, token // TokenOK returns an OK that verifies the given token.func TokenOK ok okay.OK, token string  okay.OK {	return okay.Verify ok, func ctx context.Context   bool, error  {		tok, ok := ctx.Value authToken{} 
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Authentication	string 		if !ok {		}		return tok == token, nil	} 
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Authorization	Authorization is provided via the Allow   function, which allows access toThe fs package  or consumers of it  might implement the following:package fsimport  	"strings"	"okay" func AllowFiles ok okay.OK, file ...string  OK {	check := make map string bool 	for _, f := range file {		check f  = true	}	return okay.Allow ok, func i interface{}   bool, error  {		f, ok := i
google-readmegoogle-okay.md	Authorization	string 		if !ok {		}		return check f , nil	} func AllowPrefix ok okay.OK, pfx string  OK {	return okay.Allow ok, func i interface{}   bool, error  {		f, ok := i

google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	Open Location Code for Swift	   ! Carthage compatible  Convert between decimal degree coordinates and Open Location Codes
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	Open Location Code for Swift	Shortenand recover Open Location Codes for a given reference location.This repository is the Swift implementation of Open Location Code.It supports Swift and Objective-C projects on iOS, macOS, tvOS andwatchOS, and Swift projects on Linux
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	Open Location Code for Swift	The master repository has Open Location Code support for many other languages.
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	 Open Location Codes  are short, 10-11 charactercodes that can be used instead of street addresses
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	The codes can be generatedand decoded offline, and use a reduced character set that minimises the chanceof codes including words.Codes are able to be shortened relative to a nearby location
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	This meansthat in many cases, only four to seven characters of the code are needed.To recover the original code, the same location is not required, as long asa nearby location is provided.Codes represent rectangular areas rather than points, and the longer thecode, the smaller the area
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	A 10 character code represents a 13.5x13.5meter area  at the equator
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	An 11 character code represents approximatelya 2.8x3.5 meter area.Two encoding algorithms are used
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	The first 10 characters are pairs ofcharacters, one for latitude and one for latitude, using base Each pairreduces the area of the code by a factor of Only even code lengths aresensible, since an odd-numbered length would have sides in a ratio of 20:At position 11, the algorithm changes so that each character selects oneposition from a 4x5 grid
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	About Open Location Codes	This allows single-character refinements.
google-readmegoogle-open-location-code-swift.md	Supported Environments	This library is provided as a Swift and Objective-C Cocoa Frameworkfor iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, and as a pure Swift modulefor macOS and Linux.

google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	OpenHTF	The open-source hardware testing framework
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	OpenHTF	    Issue Stats 
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Overview	OpenHTF is a Python library that provides a set of convenient abstractionsdesigned to remove as much boilerplate as possible from hardware test setup andexecution, so test engineers can focus primarily on test logic
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Overview	It aspires todo so in a lightweight and minimalistic fashion
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Overview	It is general enough to beuseful in a variety of hardware testing scenarios, from the lab bench to themanufacturing floor.
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Installing OpenHTF	an isolated Python environments for your projects, so as to protect system-widePython packages the OS depends upon
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Installing OpenHTF	The installation instructions assume you've_already_ created a virtualenv and activated it if you wish to do so.
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Option 1: Installing via 'pip'  recommended 	The most straightforward way to get the openhtf Python package into yourPython environment is simply to install it via pip  This will install the most recentproduction release.If you want to install from source instead  for example, if you want some newfeature that hasn't made it to the production release yet , you can download the source code  via git  or other means, and install the openhtf packageinto your Python environment using the standard setup.py script.The fastest way to get started is to take a look in the examples/ directory,where you'll find sample test scripts and plugs
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Option 1: Installing via 'pip'  recommended 	In addition, many of OpenHTF'smodules are fairly well documented inline through the use of docstrings.Note: some of the python setup.py build command
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Option 1: Installing via 'pip'  recommended 	 This requires protocol buffer compilerlibrary to be installed  additional instructions  CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-your-dev-environment  .
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Nomenclature	OpenHTF uses certain nomenclature internally for several of its core concepts.Some of the more important terms are listed here for clarity.
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	DUT  Device Under Test 	DUT refers to an individual piece of hardware being evaluated, exercised, or
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	The top-level abstraction that OpenHTF deals with is the test
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	A test is justa series of steps performed on/with a DUT, usually along with somedata-gathering or measurement steps
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	In the OpenHTF paradigm, tests areexpressed as regular Python programs  .py files  that import and instantiate the'Test' class from the openhtf module
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	That way test code is as straightforwardas possible to read and write
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	This also provides for the flexibility to doanything in a test that can normally be done in Python
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	Superficially, whatdistinguishes an OpenHTF test from any other Python program is that the OpenHTFtest imports the openhtf package, instantiates the Test class, and callsits Execute   function
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	From there, OpenHTF manages the setup, execution,and teardown of the test, keeps track of anything gathered, and provides apass/fail result.At times it may be necessary to disambiguate between different common readingsof the word _test_
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	In such scenarios we use the following more precise terms:_Stations_ capture the notion that a given test ran at some point and may runagain
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	It loosely reflects the idea of physical test stations that processmultiple DUTs over time
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	OpenHTF writes a breadcrumb to the filesystem  in adirectory that can be set using the --rundir flag  each time a test runs, andall tests that have the same name are considered to be of the same station
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Test	Thisway the web frontend can display a consolidated list of known tests as a list of
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Phase	OpenHTF tests are broken down into logical blocks called _phases_
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Phase	Phases are nomore than normal Python callables  usually functions  combined with the neededmetadata
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Phase	Writing an OpenHTF test is just a matter of writing a bunch of phasefunctions and specifying the order in which they should be executed.
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Measurement	OpenHTF gathers data about a DUT in the form of _measurements_
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Measurement	Usually,measurements are declared along with a specification that describes whatconstitutes a "passing" value
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Measurement	If OpenHTF finishes the test run and one or moremeasurements were out of that spec, the result of the whole test run will beconsidered a fail.
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Attachment	Sometimes may want to capture additional data that is more complex or free-formthan a measurement
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Attachment	An _attachment_ can link arbitrary binary data to atest record, along with an optional MIME type.
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Plug	The essence of an OpenHTF test is to interact with a DUT to exercise it invarious ways and observe the result
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Plug	Sometimes this is done by communicatingdirectly with the DUT, and other times it's done by communicating with a pieceof test equipment to which the DUT is attached in some way
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Plug	A _plug_ is a pieceof code written to enable OpenHTF to interact with a particular type of hardware,whether that be a DUT itself or a piece of test equipment
google-readmegoogle-openhtf.md	Plug	OpenHTF comespackaged with a growing collection of useful plugs, but supports thecreation of custom plugs as well.
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	OpenPGP interoperability tests	This directory contains simple test cases to read OpenPGP keys and messages generated by a variety of implementations
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	OpenPGP interoperability tests	The tests are declarative, and any implementation can write a driver for these tests to check for interoperability issues.These test cases are not exhaustive by any means, and should be viewed as a simple check that messages and keys generated by various implementations can interoperate with each other.
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Format of a test case	Tests are based on a naming convention
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Format of a test case	Any file ending with .json is assumed to be a JSON file that declares a new test case
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Format of a test case	It _must_ have an string field called type that declares the type of test case.There are currently two types of tests
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Format of a test case	An __import__ test, and a __decrypt__ test.
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	This test expects the implementation to read a public key, validate it, and reject any invalid userids or subkeys
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	An example JSON file mykey.jsonThe public key is located by a naming convention, and found in the same directory by replacing the .json extension with .asc
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	So in this example, the public key to read is mytest.asc within the same directory as the JSON file.All the fields in the JSON file  except for the type field  are optional
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	But if a field is present, the implementation must confirm that after validation, it has the same information represented by the field
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	Unknown fields must be ignored.expected_uids is an optional array of strings
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	This contains an array of  validated  UserID strings in the same order as was present in the key.expected_fingerprint is an optional fingerprint of the primary key.expected_subkeys is an optional array of objects representing each valid subkey  in the same order as was present in the key
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Import test	 Each object may also include an optional expected_fingerprint field for the subkey fingerprint.
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Decrypt test	This test expects the implementation to decrypt a message using a provided private key, and verify it if  an optional  public key is provided
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Decrypt test	An example JSON file mymessage.jsonThe message to decrypt is located by a naming convention, and found in the same directory by replacing the .json extension with .asc
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Decrypt test	So in this example, the message to decrypt is mymessage.asc within the same directory as the JSON file.decryptKey is a _required_ string field, and is the name of a file within the same directory
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Decrypt test	This file contains a private key that can decrypt the message.passphrase is a _required_ string field, and provides a passphrase to unlock the private key.verifyKey is an optional string field
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Decrypt test	If present, it is the name of a file within the same directory
google-readmegoogle-openpgp-interop.md	Decrypt test	This file contains a public key, and the message must be signed by it.filename is an optional string field that is the filename indicated by the message.timestamp is an optional numeric field that is the creation timestamp indicated by the message.textcontent is an optional string field and is the expected content of the file.

google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	History	This project is the result of an initiative by the  JUnit Lambda team 
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Status Quo	There is no standard for testing on the JVM: the only common building block we have is java.lang.AssertionError.AssertionError is great for signaling that a test has failed, but it doesn't go far enough
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Status Quo	Each testing framework is therefore forced to fill the gap with custom subclasses of AssertionError or RuntimeException to provide a richer feature set to end users
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Status Quo	The downside is that each framework has its **own*For example, JUnit has long supported the notion of a _failed assumption_ via its AssumptionViolatedException, but assertion frameworks like AssertJ cannot integrate that feature without a direct dependency on JUnit
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Status Quo	Furthermore, the status quo makes the work of IDEs and build tools more difficult than it should be.
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Proposal	The only real solution to this problem is to create a foundation that we can all build on!Based on recent discussions with IDE and build tool developers from Eclipse, Gradle, and IntelliJ, the JUnit Lambda team is working on a proposal for an open source project to provide a minimal common foundation for testing libraries on the JVM
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Proposal	The primary goal of the project is to enable testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, Spock, etc
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Proposal	and third-party assertion libraries like Hamcrest, AssertJ, etc
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Proposal	to use a common set of exceptions that IDEs and build tools can support in a consistent manner across all testing scenarios -
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Draft Implementation	We have begun with a small set of errors and exceptions that we consider to be common for all testing and assertion frameworks
google-readmegoogle-opentest4j.md	Draft Implementation	In fact, early drafts of these errors and exceptions are already used in the  JUnit Lambda Project .Please take a look at our current draft in this project and let us know what you think.

google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	For example:exist, it would have null value
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	Starting from version 3, @optional is removed and these entities nolonger return as null
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	For PageLoaderElement, you directly useits .exists getter to check or use provided matchers.import 'package:pageloader/testing.dart';PageLoaderElement myElement = ...;expect myElement.exists, isTrue ;expect myElement, exists ;For PageObjects, use provided matchers:import 'package:pageloader/testing.dart';SomePO somePO = SomePO.create context ;expect somePO, exists ;What is synchronous/asynchronous?PageLoaderElements in version 3.0.0 and above use both synchronousand asynchronous calls in the API
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	The basic rule is as follows:any call that cannot change the DOM is synchronous, and any callthat can change the DOM is asynchronous.For example, reading DOM attributes or finding elements is synchronous.Click and typing are still asynchronous.Interactions, e.g
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	clicking, typing, etc
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	still return Futures
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	Why?Remember that component tests actually run in the browser, with the component,in the same thread
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	Dart  like JavaScript  has no threads, so if the test isdoing something then the component is not
google-readmegoogle-pageloader.md	WebdriverPageLoaderElement example:	If the whole test is synchronousit'll execute start to finish without any pause, as one massive action inthe event loop.So, we'll type something, but the component won't update..

google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Overview	pam-cryptsetup provides a PAM module that allows LUKS-based disk encryption passwords to bekept in sync with account passwords automatically based on factors like if the user hasdecypted the disk successfully previously.
google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Module Configuration	When adding this module to an authentication stack, it is recommended to use either the ' default=ignore ' or 'optional' flags and to place the entry for the module at the very end of the PAM config file sequence, as one probably doesn't want authentication of a user hinging on a module that doesn't provide any.
google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Arguments:	For an encrypted device at /dev/mapper/rootdev_crypt:
google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Crypt Slot Cache	All user information, such as which  if any  slot was most recently unlocked with their login password, is recoded in /var/cache/libpam-cryptsetup as a GLib string array.The default format, before any unlocking has happened, is as follows:where each string associates with one of the 8 LUKS slots  numbered 0-7  available
google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Crypt Slot Cache	Once a user's password has sucessfully unlocked a slot on the disk, their username is added to the string associated with the number slot unlocked.For example, if we had a user "kathy" unlock slot 3, the cache would be updated as follows:Next time kathy authenticates, this info will be used to determine the appropriate action for the module to take.
google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Operation	During authentication, the module takes the following information into account:Authentication mode:
google-readmegoogle-pam-cryptsetup.md	Building	Built with autotools and includes an autogen.sh script: ./autogen.sh ./configure make make check #  optional  sudo make install

google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	What is it	structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data botheasy and intuitive
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	What is it	It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block fordoing practical, **real world*the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source dataanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	What is it	It is already well onits way toward this goal.
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Main Features	Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Where to get it	The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Pythonpackage index
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Notes about HTML parsing libraries	  pandas.read_html will **not*  installed
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Notes about HTML parsing libraries	 installation and usage of the above three libraries
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Notes about HTML parsing libraries	 libraries  sudo apt-get build-dep python-lxml    This will prevent further headaches down the line.
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Installation from sources	To install pandas from source you need Cython in addition to the normaldependencies above
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Installation from sources	Cython can be installed from pypi:cloning the git repo , execute:in automatically  the -e option is for installing it in  developmentmode 
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Documentation	The official documentation is hosted on PyData.org: The Sphinx documentation should provide a good starting point for learning howto use the library
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Documentation	Expect the docs to continue to expand as time goes on.
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Background	Work on pandas started at AQR  a quantitative hedge fund  in 2008 andhas been under active development since then.
google-readmegoogle-pandas.md	Discussion and Development	Since pandas development is related to a number of other scientificPython projects, questions are welcome on the scipy-user mailinglist

google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI	A clone of  dat.GUI  using nice Polymer  1.0   paper elements
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI	One of the advantages is that this makes it touch and mobile friendly
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI	The API is intentionally similar, although not all features have been ported to PaperGUI.
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Install	Building requires node, gulp and bower.The dist folder contains the build
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Install	The paper-gui.html file is the only oneyou need if you want to use web component-style, synchronous import.Otherwise, you'll need all 3 files in the dist folder as paperGUI.js loadsthe other two.To try out the demo, run a webserver in the papergui root folder, eg:Then open  in a browser.
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Basic usage	With very little code, PaperGUI creates an interface that you can use to modify variables, exactly like  dat.GUI  from which the below example is adapted.var FizzyText = function   {  this.message = 'PaperGUI';  this.speed = 0.8;  this.displayOutline = false;  this.explode = function   { ..
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Basic usage	};  // Define render logic ..
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Basic usage	document.addEventListener 'PaperGUIReady', function e  {  var text = new FizzyText  ;  var gui = new PaperGUI  ;  gui.add text, 'message' ;  gui.add text, 'speed', -5, 5 ;  gui.add text, 'displayOutline' ;  gui.add text, 'explode' ;As shown above, the paperGUI.js script loads a polyfill and then imports the web components necessary for the PaperGUI library to work
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Basic usage	Once it's all set, it triggers a PaperGUIReady event
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Basic usage	This allows to delay the loading of PaperGUI as much as possible.Alternatively, you can skip the loader script call and use a  blocking  import directly
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Basic usage	Add this at the top of your HTML:
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Constrain	You can specify limits on numbers
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Constrain	A number with a min and max value becomes a slider
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Constrain	This is exactly the  same API as dat.GUI // Choose from accepted valuesgui.add text, 'message',   'pizza', 'chrome', 'hooray'    ;// Choose from named valuesgui.add text, 'speed', { Stopped: 0, Slow: 0.1, Fast: 5 }  ;
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Events	You can listen for events on individual controllers using an event listener syntax.var controller = gui.add fizzyText, 'maxSize', 0, 10 ;controller.onChange function value  {  // Fires on every change, drag, keypress, etc.} ;Note: the onFinishChange handler  from dat.GUI  is currently not supported.
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Styling & positioning	PaperGUI exposes custom CSS properties and mixins  see  Polymer documentation  through which you can change the colors and style of the UI.
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Custom properties	Properties below can be used to modify the default colors of the PaperGUI interface and components:| Custom Property| ----------------------------------| --paper-gui-accent-color| --paper-gui-accent-contrast-color | Applied to fonts and icons where the background uses accent color  buttons   || --paper-gui-background-color| --paper-gui-text-color| --paper-gui-ui-color| --paper-gui-ui-secondary-color
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Example	In your main html file:
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI constructor parameters	The PaperGUI constructor can accept an object containing various options  eg
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI constructor parameters	var gui = new PaperGUI {autoPlace: false} ; | Property name | Type| autoPlace   | Boolean | Whether to automatically append the PaperGUI element to the DOM as soon as at least one controller has been added
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI constructor parameters	Default is **true**
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI constructor parameters	|
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI methods	PaperGUI has several methods.| Method name | Description || add  | el  | open  | close     | Closes the dialog containing the controllers
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI methods	Equivalent to clicking the close button in the dialog
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	PaperGUI methods	|| hide  | show  Here's a summary of the controller types PaperGUI currently supports:| PaperGUI Controller type | Property type | Extra parameters || Button| Toggle| Text input| Select box| Slider| Select box
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Controller methods	All controller methods return themselves, allowing to chain method calls
google-readmegoogle-paper-gui.md	Controller methods	Here is a list of methods.| Method| name labelString | onChange callbackFunction  | Calls the function when the value changes| min minNumber | max minNumber | step stepNumber 
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	param_runner	param_runner.sh is a minimalistic task batching / queueing tool built on top of etcd version 3, written as a bash script library.In order to use param_runner, write your own task as a bash function that takes parameters to partition work item, then pass the function as an argument to param_runner::run
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	param_runner	The following example illustrates the usage of this library end to end.
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	Installation	etcdctl commandline tool is required
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	Installation	See  etcd  document for instructions on getting etcd, which also bundles etcdctl
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	Installation	You can either put etcdctl in PATH, or path to etcdctl can be specified by --param_runner_etcdctl_bin flag.Apart from bash, coreutils and etcdctl executable, the only external dependency is  jq  used for commandline json parsing
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	Installation	jq is widely available as binary package in most popular OS distributions
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	Installation	In Ubuntu, install jq by doing:Suppose we have a simple addition calculating job defined  see  the included example  example/calc_and_sleep_etcd.sh  for the full example :
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	#!/bin/bash	source path/to/param_runner_etcd.sh || exit 1FLAGS "$@" || exit 1set -extra_flags=  "$@"  function run {  echo "Task example $1: $2 + $3 = $  $2 + $3  "  echo "${extra_flags @ }"param_runner::run runNote that param_runner.sh sources shflags, and it is the wrapping script's job to initialize FLAGS  after defining its own flags 
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	#!/bin/bash	This job takes three parameters, the name of task and two numbers whose sum will be an output of the job
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	#!/bin/bash	Also note the extra_flags handling
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	#!/bin/bash	This allows us to specify parameters at run time independent of the parameter sets
google-readmegoogle-param_runner.md	#!/bin/bash	Now run the example:Note that we use etcdctl version 3 API.Running with parameter set found at /ls/test/home/$USER/param_runner/param/1Task example 1plusTen: 1 + 10 = 11--some --extra=argumentParameter set 1 succeededWe can see the execution results by listing /result path:Once we are done with the tasks, we can place poison pill so that the param runner will exit gracefully.See the included example  Docker file  Dockerfile.example .

google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Introducing patrick	This package is an extension to testthat that enables parameterized unittesting in R.
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	The release version of patrick is available on CRAN
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	Install it in the usualInstall it using devtools.Many packages within R employ the following pattern when writing tests:test_that "Data is a successfully converted: numeric", {  input <  expect_is input, "numeric" } test_that "Data is a successfully converted: character", {  input <  expect_is input, "character" } While explicit, recycling a test pattern like this is prone to user error andother issues, as it is a violation of the classic DNRY rule  do not repeatyourself 
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	patrick eliminates this problem by creating test parameters.usual, you call all of your tests with devtools::test, and they'll also runduring package checks
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	Each executes independently and then your test reportwill produce a single report
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	A complete name for each test will be formed usingthe initial test description and the strings in the test_name parameter.Small sets of cases can be reasonably passed as parameters towith_parameters_test_that
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	This becomes less readable when the number of casesincreases
google-readmegoogle-patrick.md	Installing	To help mitigate this issue, patrick provides a case generatorhelper function.This package is inspired by parameterized testing packages in other languages,notably the  parameterized  libraryin Python.

google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	The Physical Web	The Physical Web is an effort to extend the superpower of the web At its base, the Physical Web is a discovery service: a smart object broadcasts relevant URLs that any nearby device can receive
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	The Physical Web	This simple capability can unlock exciting new ways to interact with the Web
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	The Physical Web	 
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Why URLs?	The URL is the fundamental building block of the web, giving remarkable flexibility of expression
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Why URLs?	It can be:The number of smart objects is going to explode, both in our homes and in public spaces
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Why URLs?	Much like the web, there is going to be a long tail of interactivity for smart objects
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Why URLs?	But the overhead of installing an app for each one just doesn’t  scale
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Why URLs?	We need a system that lets you walk up and use a device with just a tap
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Why URLs?	The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps; it’s about allowing interaction for the times when native apps just aren’t practical.
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Open Design	The Physical Web must be an open standard that everyone can use
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Open Design	This can’t be a product that is locked down by a single company
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Open Design	Like many web specifications, this is an open source design that is being released early so everyone can experiment and comment on it
google-readmegoogle-physical-web.md	Open Design	There is much to discuss and add to this specification.

google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Pik	 ! Build status  build-status-img   build-status Pik is a new lossy image format for the internet
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Pik	This directory containsan encoder and a decoder for the format.This project is in the initial research stage, please don't use it for any
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Project Goals	Pik is to have roughly the same performance requirements space thatJPEG is holding today
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Project Goals	We aim to have roughly similar decoding speed,i.e., no more than 50 % slower in decoding, but adding more moderncompression and prediction methods, giving 55 % more density
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Project Goals	We plan toimprove to 65 % before freezing the format
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Project Goals	Some of these new advances maycome with a moderate drop in decoding speed  possibly 40 % of jpeg speed .The bitstream supports tiles so that multi-core decoding can decode a singleimage faster  up to 1 GB/s .We are planning to keep the format 8x8 DCT based, possibly with some supportfor non-integral-transform-based direct mode blocks  or overlay blocks .
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Build instructions	The software currently requires an AVX2 and FMA capable CPU, e.g
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Build instructions	Haswell.Please run git submodule init && git submodule update, then make -j8, whichcreates cpik and dpik binaries in bin/.The --distance command line argument to cpik is a Butteraugli distance  see which indicates the largest acceptableerror
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Build instructions	Larger values lead to smaller files and lower quality
google-readmegoogle-pik.md	Build instructions	Try 1.0 for avisually lossless result.

google-readmegoogle-pinotify.md	PiNotify project	PiNotify seeks to provide a way to notify and send short  140 character  messages via a tabletdisplay, along with physical blinking lights and a physical button.The flashing lights will blink until the message is acknowledged.See PiNotify Design.py for more details about the project design.
google-readmegoogle-pinotify.md	Disclaimer	This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-pinotify.md	Setup	The project consists of 3 apps that work in concert: a backend and web UI that runs on GoogleAppEngine, an Android app that runs on the tablet, and a Raspberry Pi app that controls the lightsand physical button based on Bluetooth commands from the tablet.Before the AppEngine and Android apps can be built and run, some setup is required
google-readmegoogle-pinotify.md	Setup	Most of thissetup involves creating keys for Firebase Push Notifications and Google Cloud Endpoints, which areused to allow the Android app to communicate with the backend.Comments marked in the code with SETUP_TODO are things that need to be done to build, run, andSome of this setup can probably be simplified in the future.Setup steps:Create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable AppEngine on pip install -t lib google-endpoints --ignore-installedFollow the instructions atIn app/src/main/java/com/pinotify/BackendService.java, enter the Cloud Endpoints audience.In appengine/api.py, enter the Android and web client IDs from your project's Cloud ConsoleIn appengine/web_handlers.py, add your Firebase cloud messaging API key.Follow the instructions onWhen you launch the Android app, you'll need to enter the backend service URL

google-readmegoogle-platform.dart.md	Platform	 ! Build Status -   ! Coverage Status -   ! Pub  A generic platform abstraction for Dart.Like dart:io, package:platform supplies a rich, Dart-idiomatic API foraccessing platform-specific information.package:platform provides a lightweight wrapper around the static Platformproperties that exist in dart:io
google-readmegoogle-platform.dart.md	Platform	However, it uses instance properties ratherthan static properties, making it possible to mock out in tests.
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	What are Platform Benchmark?	Platform Benchmarks are a benchmark suite to measure basic architecturalmetrics of a platform
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	What are Platform Benchmark?	Currently it only consists of CPUtest and AnalogCPUtest is a set of microbenchmarks to measure fundamental micro-architecturalcharacteristics of a CPU.Analog benchmarks are synthesized benchmarks that mimics some relevant workloadin Google cloud
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	What are Platform Benchmark?	Since we have a very dyanmic workload, over the time theseAnalog benchmarks would change or even become obsolete.Some fundamental properties of CPUtest
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Writing C code	Write test in C
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Writing C code	Have test measure wall clock time at the beginning and end
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Writing C code	Return a simple measure  eg: operations per second Here is an example test to measure the latency of dependent ALU ops.struct Result dostuff1   {  uint64_t t = now_nsec  ;  strcpy result.function, __FUNCTION__ ;  result.resulthash = a;  strcpy result.metricname, "Stuff per second" ;  return result;

google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	BUILD file	Create the appropriate targets in the BUILD file.
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Compiling and building the benchmarks	Building the benchmark can be configured and managed by Bazel Please note that this benchmark is only tested in Linux systems
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Compiling and building the benchmarks	Therefore wecannot guarantee it would work in other systems yet.Users external to Google can set environment variable $CC to specify whichcompiler should be used to build the benchmark
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Compiling and building the benchmarks	However, it is stronglysuggested to use LLVM compiler
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Compiling and building the benchmarks	GNU tool chain is very inefficient in handlingthe large inline assembly chunk inside the benchmarks
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Compiling and building the benchmarks	Our experiment shows thatit takes several hours to build **bigtable_analog*several minutes with LLVM.Please compile the benchmark in debug mode  -c dbg , with no optimizations,and force static linking  --linkopt=-static .
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Testing the test	Using traditional unit testing techniques for CPUtest can catch cerebralflatulence on the part of the developer, but cannot get at fundamental issues inthe test
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Testing the test	Generally the best way is to run the test on a target machine of knownfrequency and of known micro-architectural characteristics  as described inmanuals 
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Testing the test	If the test produces results consistent with disclosures from thevendor, then there is a strong likelihood that the test is correct/robust
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Testing the test	Whilemodifying a test, it is good practice to check the result against the existingMPM
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Testing the test	There are two shell scripts that help you do that...
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	test.sh	Runs on the host machine
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	test.sh	Copies CPUtest executable from bazel-bin directory,copies test-on-target.sh to target machine and runs it.Runs on target machine
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	test.sh	Fetches latest cputest MPM, runs it and the copied overexecutable for the cputest arguments passed in.TIP: Remember to build cputest for the correct architecture before running test.sh on a particular target machine.cputestFetched package platforms/benchmarks/microbenchmarks/cputest version latest.mpm/cputestmax_scalar_store_ipc	resulthash=1048576	GOPS=3.422395max_scalar_store_ipc	resulthash=1048576	GOPS=3.424247In this case, the local version and the MPM version produce virtually the sameresult
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	test.sh	Sometimes test result differences can be intentional
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	test.sh	Correctness is forthe test writer to ascertain depending on the context.
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	How do I run a test?	Fetch the  MPM  like this on the target machineYou can simply run it as follows  to measure ALU latency  ...
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Thread and numa node binding	Often, to run a test reliably, you need to bind it to a particular logical thread using taskset or numactl
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Thread and numa node binding	Otherwise the scheduler might migrate your test to a differnet hardware thread unexpectedly, causing your result to become suspect.
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Using taskset	To bind cputest to logical thread 16 ....numactl is a third party utility that lets you bind a task to not just a thread  or a combination thereof , but also a particular memory node
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Using taskset	This is useful for tests that exercise the memory subsystem  eg: measuring memory bandwidth numactl is available as a multi-arch  MPM On the target machine, fetch the mpm as follows ...To bind the cputest run to logical core 16 and numa node 0 do...
google-readmegoogle-platform_benchmarks.md	Using taskset	assuming you fetched the cputest mpm as described before If you are running a test to evaluate structural hazards that come to the fore when multiple logical threads share and contend for the same resource, you can invoke cputest multiple times..Example: If logical threads 16, 17, 18 and 19, all share the same physical core, you can run a test on all of them concurrently as follows
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Overview	The Google Play Instant Plugin for Unity Beta simplifies conversion of a Unity-based Android app into an instant app that can be deployed through  Google Play Instant The plugin’s Unity Editor  IDE  features include:
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Prerequisites	After import there will be a “PlayInstant” menu in Unity providing several options described below.
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build Settings...	Opens a window that enables switching between "Installed" and "Instant" development modes
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build Settings...	Switching to "Instant" performs the following changes:The Play Instant Build Settings window also provides control over the scenes included in the build:Opens a window that lists Android Player Settings that should be changed to make the app Google Play Instant compatible
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build Settings...	These are divided into Required and Recommended settings
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build Settings...	Click on an “Update” button to change a setting.
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Set up Instant Apps Development SDK...	Installs or updates the “Instant Apps Development SDK” using  sdkmanager  The plugin requires SDK version 1.2 or higher
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Set up Instant Apps Development SDK...	If there is a license that needs to be accepted, the plugin will prompt for acceptance.
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build for Play Console...	 Google Play Console  requires that the APKs for an instant app are published together in a ZIP file
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build for Play Console...	Although most Unity instant apps will consist of a single APK, the requirement holds
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build for Play Console...	This menu option performs a build and stores the resulting APK in a ZIP file suitable for publishing.
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build and Run	This option runs the instant app on an adb connected device by performing the following steps:The goal of many instant apps is to give users a chance to experience the app before installing the full version
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build and Run	The plugin provides methods for transferring state from instant to installed app and for displaying a Play Store install dialog
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Build and Run	These methods are also available via  Google Play Services Java APIs  but the plugin's C# implementations are easier to use in Unity.
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Show Install Prompt	An instant app with an "Install" button can display a Play Store install dialog by calling the following from an install button click handler:The Cookie API provides methods for passing a "cookie"  e.g
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Show Install Prompt	player ID or level completion data  from an instant app to its corresponding installed app
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Show Install Prompt	Unlike postInstallIntent extras, the "cookie" state is available even if the user doesn't immediately launch the installed app
google-readmegoogle-play-instant-unity-plugin.md	Show Install Prompt	For example, an instant app could call the following code from an install button click handler:

google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Pretty Tensor 	Pretty Tensor provides a high level builder API for TensorFlow
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Pretty Tensor 	It providesthin wrappers on Tensors so that you can easily build multi-layer neuralPretty Tensor provides a set of objects that behave likes Tensors, but alsosupport a chainable object syntax to quickly define neural networksand other layered architectures in TensorFlow.Please look here for full documentation of the PrettyTensor object for allavailable operations: Available Operations  docs/PrettyTensor.md  or you can check out the  completedocumentation  docs/pretty_tensor_top_level.md See the tutorial directory for samples: tutorial/  prettytensor/tutorial/ 
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Installation	The easiest installation is just to use pip:Follow the instructions atpip install prettytensor
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Full power of TensorFlow is easy to use	Pretty Tensors can be used  almost  everywhere that a tensor can
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Full power of TensorFlow is easy to use	 Just callpt.wrap to make a tensor pretty.You can also add any existing TensorFlow function to the chain using apply applies the current Tensor as the first argument and takes all the otherarguments as normal.world.
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Plays well with other libraries	It also uses standard TensorFlow idioms so that it plays well with otherlibraries, this means that you can use it a little bit in a model or throughout.Just make sure to run the update_ops on each training set see  with_update_ops  docs/pretty_tensor_top_level.md#with_update_ops  .
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Terse	You've already seen how a Pretty Tensor is chainable and you may have noticedthat it takes care of handling the input shape
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Terse	 One other feature worth notingare defaults
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Terse	 Using defaults you can specify reused values in a single placewithout having to repeat yourself.Check out the documentation to see all supported defaults  docs/pretty_tensor_top_level.md#defaults_scope .
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Code matches model	Sequential mode lets you break model construction across lines and providesthe subdivide syntactic sugar that makes it easy to define and understandcomplex structures like an  inception module ! Inception module showing branch and rejoin  inception_module.png Templates provide guaranteed parameter reuse and make unrolling recurrentnetworks easy:There are also some convenient shorthands for LSTMs and GRUs:! Unrolled RNN  unrolled_lstm.png 
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Extensible	You can call any existing operation by using apply and it will simplysubsitute the current tensor for the first argument.You can also create a new operation  There are two supported registrationmechanisms to add your own functions
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Extensible	@Register   allows you to create amethod on PrettyTensor that operates on the Tensors and returns either a loss ora new value
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Extensible	Name scoping and variable scoping are handled by the framework.The following method adds the leaky_relu method to every Pretty Tensor:@RegisterCompoundOp   is like adding a macro, it is designed to group togethercommon sets of operations.
google-readmegoogle-prettytensor.md	Safe variable reuse	Within a graph, you can reuse variables by using templates

google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Adding the plugin to your project	This plugin must work with either the Java plugin or the Android plugin.
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Using the apply method	The Java plugin or the Android plugin must be applied before the Protobuf plugin:
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Using the Gradle plugin DSL	The order of the plugins doesn't matter:The Protobuf plugin assumes Protobuf files  protoc run, and the generated files are added to the input of the Javacompilation run of that _sourceSet_  or _variant_ .
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Customizing source directories	The plugin adds a new sources block named src/$sourceSetName/proto
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Customizing source directories	You can customize it in the same way as you wouldcustomize the java sources.The plugin adds a protobuf block to the project
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Customizing source directories	It provides all theconfiguration knobs.
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Locate external executables	By default the plugin will search for the protoc executable in the systemsearch path
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Locate external executables	We recommend you to take the advantage of pre-compiled protocthat we have published on Maven Central:Multiple assignments are allowed in the protoc block
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Locate external executables	The last one wins.You may also run protoc with codegen plugins
google-readmegoogle-protobuf-gradle-plugin.md	Locate external executables	You need to define all thecodegen plugins you will use in the plugins block, by specifying thedownloadable artifact or a local path, in the same syntax as in the protocblock above

google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	 Documentation This library is a pull parser for  CommonMark  writtenin  Rust  It comes with a simple command-line tool,useful for rendering to HTML, and is also designed to be easy to use from asa library.It is designed to be:There are many parsers for Markdown and its variants, but to my knowledge noneuse pull parsing
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Pull parsing has become popular for XML, especially formemory-conscious applications, because it uses dramatically less memory thanconstructing a document tree, but is much easier to use than push parsers
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Pushparsers are notoriously difficult to use, and also often error-prone because ofthe need for user to delicately juggle state in a series of callbacks.In a clean design, the parsing and rendering stages are neatly separated, butthis is often sacrificed in the name of performance and expedience
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Many Markdownimplementations mix parsing and rendering together, and even designs that tryto separate them  such as the popular  hoedown make the assumption that the rendering process can be fully represented as aserialized string.Pull parsing is in some sense the most versatile architecture
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	It's possible todrive a push interface, also with minimal memory, and quite straightforward toconstruct an AST
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Another advantage is that source-map information  the mappingbetween parsed blocks and offsets within the source text  is readily available;you basically just call get_offset   as you consume events.While manipulating AST's is the most flexible way to transform documents,operating on iterators is surprisingly easy, and quite efficient
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Here, forexample, is the code to transform soft line breaks into hard breaks:A lot of the internal scanning code is written at a pretty low level  itpretty much scans byte patterns for the bits of syntax , but the externalinterface is designed to be idiomatic Rust.Pull parsers are at heart an iterator of events  start and end tags, text,and other bits and pieces 
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	The parser data structure implements theRust Iterator trait directly, and Event is an enum
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Thus, you can use thefull power and expressivity of Rust's iterator infrastructure, includingfor loops and map  as in the examples above , collecting the events intoa vector  for recording, playback, and manipulation , and more.Further, the Text event  representing text  is a copy-on-write string  note:this isn't quite true yet 
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	The vast majority of text fragments are justslices of the source document
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	For these, copy-on-write gives a convenientrepresentation that requires no allocation or copying, but allocatedstrings are available when they're needed
google-readmegoogle-pulldown-cmark.md	pulldown-cmark	Thus, when rendering text toHTML, most text is copied just once, from the source document to theHTML buffer.

google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	Python portpicker module	This module is useful for finding unused network ports on a host.It supports both Python 2 and Python This module provides a pure Python pick_unused_port   function.It can also be called via the command line for use in shell scripts.If your code can accept a bound TCP socket rather than a port number considerusing socket.bind  'localhost', 0   to bind atomically to an available portrather than using this library at all.There is a race condition between picking a port and your application codebinding to it
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	Python portpicker module	 The use of a port server by all of your test code to avoidthat problem is recommended on loaded test hosts running many tests at a time.Unless you are using a port server, subsequent calls to pick_unused_port   toobtain an additional port are not guaranteed to return a unique port.
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	A port server is intended to be run as a daemon, for use by all processesrunning on the host
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 It coordinates uses of network ports by anything usinga portpicker library
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 If you are using hosts as part of a test automationcluster, each one should run a port server as a daemon
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 You should set thePORTSERVER_ADDRESS=@unittest-portserver environment variable on all of yourtest runners so that portpicker makes use of it.A sample port server is included
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 This portserver implementation works but hasnot spent time in production
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 If you use it with good results please reportback so that this statement can be updated to reflect that
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 : A port server listens on a unix socket, reads a pid from a new connection,tests the ports it is managing and replies with a port assignment port for thatpid
google-readmegoogle-python_portpicker.md	What is the optional port server?	 A port is only reclaimed for potential reassignment to another processafter the process it was originally assigned to has died

google-readmegoogle-pytruth.md	Support	PyTruth is not an actively maintained project
google-readmegoogle-pytruth.md	Support	No support is provided.It is shared with the community to bring an expressive, consistent assertionstyle to projects that may be using a combination of unittest  googletest  mox  and mock to people familiar with  Java Truth User group: pytruth-users@googlegroups.com 
google-readmegoogle-pytruth.md	Overview	Import the truth module and alias the AssertThat   method to begin asserting
google-readmegoogle-pytruth.md	Limitations	unittest assertions accept a msg parameter to display if the assertion fails.PyTruth has no such mechanism, though its failure messages tend to be moreThe type of the subject under test  the parameter passed to AssertThat    willnot be known until runtime, unlike Java where the type is known at compile time.IDEs may not correctly autocomplete available predicates on an asserted subject.In Python 2, IsNone   or IsNotNone   before performing an inequality assertion.In Python 3, None is no longer comparable using  =.PyTruth detects the version of the Python interpreter and compares or failsappropriately, rather than allowing Python 3's TypeError to bubble up.If the iterator over a shared value  either expected or actual  changes thatvalue or its underlying elements, the behavior is undefined:all, none, or some of the assertions may succeed or fail, arbitrarily.This library is threadsafe; you may execute multiple assertions in parallel.
google-readmegoogle-pytruth.md	General	-----------------------------|---------------------------------------assertFalse callable a     | AssertThat a .IsNotCallable  
google-readmegoogle-pytruth.md	Truthiness	PyTruth supports a finer grained distinction of truthiness than unittest does.In particular, it differentiates between "is True" and "is *truthy*."unittest's assertTrue x  is equivalent to assertIs bool x , True ,and its assertFalse x  is equivalent to assertIs bool x , False .PyTruth's IsTrue   and IsFalse   predicates match *onlysubjects True and False themselves.Therefore it is important not to blindly convert assertTrue   to IsTrue  ,and likewise with assertFalse   and IsFalse  .Truthy assertionAssertThat None .IsTruthy   | fails

google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Why types declarations?	Type declarations are useful to document your code
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Why types declarations?	This proposal starts aconversation with the community to reach a standard for a type declarationlanguage for Python.
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Why runtime type-checking?	Runtime type-checking of optional type declarations is useful for codemaintenance and debugging
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Why runtime type-checking?	Our type-checker is available as a Python package.You therefore do not need to run external tools to benefit from the
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Status	This project is in its infancy -couple of months
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Status	We currently support Python 2.Support for Python 3 coming
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	Types declarations are specified in an external file with theextension **"pytd"**
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	For example if you want to provide types for**"application.py"**, you define the type inside the file**"application.pytd"**
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	Examples of type declarations files can befound in the **/tests/*Here’s an example of a type declaration file that mixes several features:Python 3 function annotation convention
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	However, we extended it in a number ofways that would be difficult or clumsy using Python 3's annotations.exceptions that the function might raise
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	There is no runtime checkingfor this, but exceptions can be useful documentation and an automatedtype inferencer could deduce the possible exceptions that a functionmight throw.This is not supported in the Python 3 function annotation syntax but issupported by pytypedecl.values from a number of different types
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	Union types allow to express thisidea
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	For example float
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	There is no limit to the number of types in a union
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	A none-able typecan be seen as the union of a type and None
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	Note: None is a unit type and is a subtype of NoneType
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	Because there'sonly one subtype of NoneType, for type-specification purposes, None andNoneType are the same
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	similarly to Java generics
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Type declaration language	For example, generator describes a generatorthat only produces strs, dict describes a dictionary of keys oftype str and values of type int.
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Coming soon:	The **-B*You can also run the tests:Look into the **/examples/*works
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Coming soon:	You need to do two things to type-check your program:**Create a type declaration file**Create a type declaration file that has the name of the Python file you want totype-check but with the extension .pytd  e.g
google-readmegoogle-pytypedecl.md	Coming soon:	email.pytd for email.py **Import the checker package**Include the following two imports in the Python file that you want toThat’s it!

google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	pyu2f	  pyu2f is a python based U2F host library for Linux, Windows, and MacOS
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	pyu2f	Itprovides functionality for interacting with a U2F device over USB.
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Features	pyu2f uses ctypes to make system calls directly to interface with the USB HIDdevice
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Features	This means that no platform specific shared libraries need to becompiled for pyu2f to work.By default pyu2f will use its own U2F stack implementation to sign requests
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Features	Ifdesired, pyu2f can offload signing to a pluggable command line tool
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Features	Offloadingis not yet supported for U2F registration.
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Usage	The recommended approach for U2F signing  authentication  is through theconvenience interface:from pyu2f import modelfrom pyu2f.convenience import authenticatorregistered_key = model.RegisteredKey b64_encoded_key challenge_data =  {'key': registered_key, 'challenge': raw_challenge_data} api = authenticator.CreateCompositeAuthenticator origin response = api.Authenticate app_id, challenge_data See baseauthenticator.py for interface details.
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Authentication Plugin	The convenience interface allows for a pluggable authenticator to be defined andused instead of the built in U2F stack.This can be done by setting the SK_SIGNING_PLUGIN environment variable to theplugin tool
google-readmegoogle-pyu2f.md	Authentication Plugin	The plugin tool should follow the specification detailed inIf SK_SIGNING_PLUGIN is set, the convenience layer will invoke the signingplugin whenver Authenticate   is called.

google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	__Post-Quantum Verified Boot for IoT Devices__This repository contains work-in-progress hash-based signature verification code that is optimized for low-end ARM-based IoT devices
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	IoT devices have unique security requirements that include the following:Unlike desktops, laptops and phones, they may not be associated with an individual that could keep the device up-to-date, and they are not necessarily 'always on', or even 'occasionally on.' Furthermore, many of these devices are battery powered, with anemic compute resources and constrained bandwidth availability
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	These IoT devices are often installed, ignored, and may need to be in operation for several years
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	To keep these devices secure, it is important to support Verified Boot, and to sign Over The Air  OTA  firmware updates
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	These require signature schemes that provide compact signatures, and support efficient signature verification
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	Furthermore, since these devices may operate 'in the wild' for several years, perhaps decades, the signature scheme needs to be resilient against anticipated attacks
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	One possible attack would be due to sufficiently large quantum computers that could break RSA and ECC-based signature schemes
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	There is no consensus regarding when these quantum attacks might become practical, but it is estimated to be between 10-15 years from now
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	Hash-based signatures are believed to be resilient against quantum attacks, have been around for a few decades and hence are well-understood from a security perspective
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	They can be efficient, but their signature sizes tend to be larger than RSA/ECDSA equivalents
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	These hash-based signatures can be either stateful or stateless, and the former tend to provide more compact signatures than the latter
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	There are two candidate standards for stateful signatures, one of which is an IETF RFC, the other of which is still in the IETF draft stage:XMSS  RFC 8391 This project hosts just the signature verification portions of these schemes, which have been optimized to run on low-end ARM devices
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	The initial version of this code was authored by Crypto4A, Inc., one of our Industry partners that is based in Ottawa, Canada
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	A limitation of stateful signatures is that any misuse of state would completely break security
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	To address this, Google is collaborating with Stanford University, one of our Academic Research partners, to explore techniques to make these stateful signatures more resilient against limited misuse of state.There are currently no plans to productize, or officially support this code at this time
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	This will continue to be work-in-progress for the forseeable future
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	You are encouraged to leverage this code in your own experiments, and we welcome collaboration
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Project Quark	The initial version of this code was authored under contract from Google by Crypto4A, Inc., one of our Industry partners that is based in Ottawa, Canada.
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Building	Simple recursive Makefiles are provided at the root and module levels
google-readmegoogle-quark.md	Building	 The outputs of these Makefiles are libraries in the src/xmssmt directories which implement the verification code as well as test executables in the test module.CMake projects are also provided.

google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	Dart's built-in logging utilities are fairly low level
google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	This means each time youstart a new project you have to copy/paste a bunch of logging configurationcode to setup output locations and logging formats
google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	Quiver-log provides a set ofhigher-level abstractions to make it easier to get logging setup correctly.Specifically, there are two new concepts: appender and formatter
google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	Appendersdefine output locations like the console, http or even in-memory data structuresthat can store logs
google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	Formatters, as the name implies, allow for custom loggingHere is a simple example that sets up a SimpleStringFormatter:import 'package:logging/logging.dart';import 'package:quiver_log/log.dart';class SimpleStringFormatter implements FormatterBase {  String call LogRecord record  => record.message;main   {  var logger = new Logger 'quiver.TestLogger' ;  var appender = new InMemoryListAppender new SimpleStringFormatter   ;  appender.attachLogger logger ;That's all there is to it!Quiver-log provides three BasicLogFormatter is included and uses a "MMyy HH:mm:ss.S" format
google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	Of coursethere is no limit to what kind of appenders you can create, we have plans toadd appenders HTTP, WebSocket, DOM, Isolate and SysOut.To create a new kind of Formatter just implement the Formatter typedef or FormatterBase class ifyou need to hold state in your formtatter
google-readmegoogle-quiver-log.md	The Basics	Take a look at PrintAppender and BasicLogFormatter for an example.
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Radio Receiver	An application to listen to broadcast FM and AM radio from your Chrome browser or your ChromeBook computer using a $15 USB digital TV tuner.! Radio Receiver screenshot  image-src/interface.png 
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	What is this	Radio Receiver is a Chrome application that uses an USB digital TV receiver to capture radio signals, does FM and AM demodulation in the browser, and plays them through your computer's speakers or headphones
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	What is this	This is called SDR  Software-Defined Radio , because all the radio signal processing is done by software running in the computer.Radio Receiver is 100% written in JavaScript, but is nevertheless fast enough that it can run on a 2012 Samsung ChromeBook laptop at full quality.
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Features	Radio Receiver was written to work with an RTL-2832U-based DVB-T  European digital TV  USB receiver, with a R820T tuner chip
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Features	You can easily buy one for $15 or less by searching for  RTL2832U R820T  on your favorite online store or web search engine.You can use this application on a ChromeBook, or on any other computer running a Chrome browser
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Features	Just  install it using the Chrome Web Store  or any other mechanism, plug in your USB dongle, and click on the icon to start the Radio Receiver application.To listen to Medium Wave and Short Wave radio, you need an upconverter connected between your antenna and the USB dongle
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Features	This upconverter shifts the signals up in frequency so that they can be tuned by your dongle
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Features	You can find upconverters for sale by searching for  SDR upconverter  on your favorite online store or web search engine.
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Support	If you'd like to talk about Radio Receiver, or have any bug reports or suggestions, please post a message in  the radioreceiver Google Group Note: This is not an official Google product  experimental or otherwise , it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
google-readmegoogle-radioreceiver.md	Acknowledgements	Kudos and thanks to the  RTL-SDR project  for figuring out the magic numbers needed to drive the USB tuner.If you want to experiment further with Software-Defined Radio and listen to more things using your $15 tuner, you can try  the various programs listed on rtl-sdr.com

google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Overview	What if we could default to attack-resistant random generators without excessiveCPU cost? We introduce 'Randen', a new generator with security guarantees; itoutperforms MT19937, pcg64_c32, Philox, ISAAC and ChaCha8 in real-worldbenchmarks
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Overview	This is made possible by AES hardware acceleration and a largeFeistel permutation.
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Related work	AES-CTR  encrypting a counter  is a well-known and easy to implement generator.It has two known weaknesses:NIST 800-90a r1    is a standardized generator that ensuresbacktracking resistance, but is not fast enough for a general-purpose generator 5-10x slower than AES .
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Algorithm	The Randen generator is based upon three existing components:1   Reverie    is a sponge-like generator2   Simpira v2    constructs up to 1024-bit3   "New criterion for diffusion property"    shows thatWe combine these by plugging the larger Simpira-like permutation into Reverie.
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Performance	The implementation targets x86  Westmere , POWER 8 and ARMx86 microbenchmark results  cpb=cycles per byte, MAD=median absolute deviation :RNG | cpb | MADRandenmt19937_64ISAAC/dev/urandom  ChaCha20 BCryptGenRandom  CTR-DRBG  | 16.80 | 0.009x86 real-world benchmark  reservoir sampling :RNG | cpb | MADRandenpcg64_c32 |  3.03 | 0.009mt19937_64|  2.82 | 0.009ChaCha8   |  3.75 | 0.008Philox/dev/urandom  ChaCha20 BCryptGenRandom  CTR-DRBG  | 16.41 | 0.015
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Security	Randen is indistinguishable from random and backtracking-resistant
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Security	For moredetails and benchmarks, please seethe paper "Randen AES+Feistel+Reverie"  pending publication .
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Usage	make && bin/randen_benchmarkNote that the code relies on compiler optimizations
google-readmegoogle-randen.md	Usage	Cycles per byte mayincrease by factors of 1.6 when compiled with GCC 7.3, and 1.3 withClang 4.0.This can be mitigated by manually unrolling the loops.

google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Stability	Recki-CT is **pre-alpha*
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	What Is Recki-CT?	Recki-CT is a set of tools that implement a compiler for PHP, and is written in PHP! Specifically, Recki-CT compiles a subset of PHP code
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	What Is Recki-CT?	The subset is designed to allow a code base to be statically analyzed
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	What Is Recki-CT?	This means that global variables, dynamic variables  variable-variables, variable function calls, etc  and references are not allowed
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	What Isn't Recki-CT?	Recki-CT is not a re-implementation of PHP
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	What Isn't Recki-CT?	It aims to be a limited subset of the language  one that can be staticly reasoned about .This means that it is not designed to replace PHP, but instead augment it.
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	PHP itself isn't slow
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	It's plenty fast enough for most use-cases
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	As a language, PHP has a lot of corner cases and results in a be in there somewhere.So with Recki-CT, we take a different approach
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	Rather than rewriting the entire engine, we sit on top of an existing engine
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	The compilerthen can compile PHP code into native machine code which can out-perform most JIT compiled implementations  sometimes by very significant margins .The designed mode of operation for Recki is as an AOT  Ahead-Of-Time  compiler
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	Since it uses aggressive analysis and optimizations, runtime compilation would be a inefficient target
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Why?	Instead, an Intermediate Representation can be cached, leaving only the final conversionto machine code to happen at runtime
google-readmegoogle-recki-ct.md	Where can I find out more?	Check out the documentation!!!  Introduction and FAQ  doc/0_introduction.md   Installation  doc/1_installation.md   Basic Operation  doc/2_basic_operation.md   Types  doc/3_types.md   Intermediate Representation  doc/4_intermediate_representation.md

google-readmegoogle-redgrep.md	About	redgrep is a grep based on regular expression derivatives
google-readmegoogle-redgrep.md	About	That is,it uses regular expression derivatives to construct the DFA
google-readmegoogle-redgrep.md	About	It thenuses LLVM to JIT the DFA.Since regular expression derivatives permit the three basic Booleanoperations of disjunction  | , conjunction  &  and complement  ! ,redgrep enables you to write very powerful regular expressions veryeasily and guarantees to match them in linear time.
google-readmegoogle-redgrep.md	Building	You must have GNU make, GNU bison and either GCC or Clang.redgrep follows the "latest and greatest" in LLVMdevelopment, so you should check out the source from Subversion or  Git then configure, build, check and install as per the instructions  Debian and Ubuntu users may prefer to install the  nightlypackages  instead
google-readmegoogle-redgrep.md	Building	You should set the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable appropriately whenyou run make.

google-readmegoogle-reil.md	Building	Cmake has been used in an attempt to make downloading and building dependencies painless, but this has had the unfortunate side-effect of making the whole process more complicated than it really needs to be
google-readmegoogle-reil.md	Building	Sorry.If you have the necessary dependencies, it should be straightforward to just build the source yourself if you don't like cmake
google-readmegoogle-reil.md	Building	Apart from Unicorn, the other dependencies are all header-only libraries, and Unicorn is only required to build the tests.For a normal  cmake  buildThis translation library has a reasonable selection of unit tests to verify the translation against unicorn/qemu
google-readmegoogle-reil.md	Building	To run the tests for the aarch64 translator, you can use the following commands:See the code in reil/test for examples of how to use the translator, and the implementation in reil/interpreter.cpp for the intended semantics of the translated IL instructions.

google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	There is NOwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARIf you think you've found a bug, please report it at:please include the following information when filing a bug:In December 2011, a new branch within the Volatility project was created toexplore how to make the code base more modular, improve performance, andincrease usability
google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	The modularity allowed Volatility to be used in GRR, makingmemory analysis a core part of a strategy to enable remote live forensics
google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	 As aresult, both GRR and Volatility would be able to use each other's strengths.Over time this branch has become known as the "scudette" branch or the"Technology Preview" branch
google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	 It was always a goal to try to get these changesinto the main Volatility code base
google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	 But, after two years of ongoingdevelopment, the "Technology Preview" was never accepted into the Volatilitytrunk version.Since it seemed unlikely these changes would be incorporated in the future, itmade sense to develop the Technology Preview branch as a separate project
google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	OnDecember 13, 2013, the former branch was forked to create a new stand-aloneproject named "Rekall.” This new project incorporates changes made to streamlinethe codebase so that Rekall can be used as a library
google-readmegoogle-rekall.md	Bugs and Support	Methods for memoryacquisition and other outside contributions have also been included that werenot in the Volatility codebase.Rekall strives to advance the state of the art in memory analysis, implementingthe best algorithms currently available and a complete memory acquisition andanalysis solution for at least Windows, OSX and Linux.

google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Rerast	 ! Latest Version    Rerast is a search/replace tool for Rust code using rules
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Rerast	A rule consists of asearch pattern, a replacement and possibly some placeholders that can appear inboth the search pattern and the replacement
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Rerast	Matching is done on syntax, not ontext, so formatting doesn't matter
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Rerast	Placeholders are typed and must match thetype found in the code for the rule to apply.
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Installation	Ensuring you have the latest nightly toolchain installed  rustup update nightly  simply run:Basic operations can be performed entirely from the command lineAlternatively you can put your rule in a Rust filethen usePutting your rules in a file is required if you want to apply multiple rules at once.If you'd like to actually update your files, that can be done as follows:an Rc "r" is a placeholder which will match any expression of the type specified
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Installation	The name of the function"rule1" is not currently used for anything
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Installation	In future it may be possible to selectivelyenable/disable rules by specifying their name, so it's probably a good idea to put a slightlydescriptive name here
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Installation	Similarly, comments placed before the function may in the future be displayedto users when the rule matches
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Installation	This is not yet implemented.A function can contain multiple invocations of the replace! macro, with earlier rules taking precedence.This is useful if you want to do several replacements that make use of the same placeholders or if you wantto handle certain special patterns first, ahead of a more general match.Besides replace! there are several other replacement macros that can be used:  matched within let statements and function arguments
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Installation	 replace\_trait\_ref! instead, since trait references can appear in contexts where types cannot
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Matching macro invocations	Macro invocations can be matched so long as they expand to code that can be matched
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Matching macro invocations	Note howeverthat a macro invocation will not match against the equivalent code, nor the invocation of adifferent, but identical macro
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Matching macro invocations	This is intentional
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Matching macro invocations	When verifying a match, we check that the samesequence of expansions was followed
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Matching macro invocations	Also note, that if a macro expands to something different everytime it is invoked, it will never match
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Matching macro invocations	println! is an example of such a macro, since it generatesa constant that is referenced from the expanded code and every invocation references a different
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Order of operations	Suppose you're replacing foo a, b  with a && !b
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Order of operations	Depending on what the placeholders end up matchingand what context the entire expression is in, there may be need for extra parenthesis
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Order of operations	For exampleif the matched code was !foo x == 1, y == 2 , if we didn't add any parenthesis, we'd end up with !x== 1 && !y == 2 which clearly isn't correct
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Order of operations	Rerast detects this and adds parenthesis as needed inorder to preserve the order or precedence found in the replacement
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Order of operations	This would give ! x == 1 && ! y== 2  .
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Formatting of code	No reformatting of code is currently done
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Formatting of code	Unmatched code will not be affected
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Formatting of code	Replacement code isproduced by copying the replacement code from the rule and splicing in any matched patterns
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Formatting of code	Infuture, we may adjust identation for multi-line replacements
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Formatting of code	Running rustfmt afterwards is probablya good idea since some identation and line lengths may not be ideal.
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Recursive and overlapping matches	The first matched rule wins
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Recursive and overlapping matches	When some code is matched, no later rules will be applied to thatcode
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Recursive and overlapping matches	However, code matched to placeholders will be searched for further matches to all rules.
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Automatically determining a rule from a source code change	If you're about to make a change multiple times throughout your source code and you're using git,you can commit  or stage  your changes, make one edit then run:to determine a rule that would have produced this change
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Automatically determining a rule from a source code change	It will print the rule, then apply it toyour project
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Automatically determining a rule from a source code change	If you are happy with the changes, you can run again with --force to apply them, oryou could copy the printed rule into a .rs file and apply it with --rules_file
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Automatically determining a rule from a source code change	 kind of tricky
google-readmegoogle-rerast.md	Automatically determining a rule from a source code change	 workaround is to create a new API temporarily.See the  Rerast Cookbook  COOKBOOK.md  for more examples.

google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	Resumable Assert	!  
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	Assert replacement to continue execution in debugger	In any large app, it sometimes happens that some asserts are failing in code youdon't currently care about, and blocking the entire team from being able to runthe app until the issue is fixed is not the best workflow
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	Assert replacement to continue execution in debugger	So we usually end upmoving the execution marker past the assert line in IDE or debugger, or evencomment the assert out, recompile and relaunch
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	Assert replacement to continue execution in debugger	With Resumable Assert, you cansimply continue execution when an assertion fails in debugger, or even disableasserts that you are not interested in, so that those never bother you again._Disclaimer: be careful with that power though, since execution of potentiallybroken code may lead to unrecoverable errors in future._
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	C/C++/Objective-C	First, include or import the header:instead of the standard ones: assert    NSAssert   Once RESUMABLE_ASSERT   variant is hit in debug mode, you can ignore it andcontinue execution, or disable it permanently, or even disable all assertspermanently with corresponding lldb commands when prompted.For example, the following assert somewhere in ViewController.viewDidLoadRESUMABLE_ASSERT   macro in C uses stdout to print the failure message bydefault
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	C/C++/Objective-C	To change this behavior and use something else for logging, e.g
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	C/C++/Objective-C	 NSLog   redefine the RESUMABLE_ASSERT_LOG   macro in C like so:
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	#define RESUMABLE_ASSERT_LOG condition, format, ... 	  do {  } while  0 Similarly, you can define your own assert macro with a custom name:For Swift and other languages, we provide ResumableAssertDebugTrap   functionthat implements the core logic of resumable assert
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	#define RESUMABLE_ASSERT_LOG condition, format, ... 	You can then implementa custom assert   function somewhere in a custom Diagnostics module whichwould use ResumableAssertDebugTrap   internally:import ResumableAssert // Import the module or use a bridging header and import ResumableAssert.h.public func assert   _ condition: @autoclosure    -> Bool,  _ message: @autoclosure    -> String = "",  file: StaticString = #file,  function: StaticString = #function,  line: UInt = #line  {
google-readmegoogle-resumable-assert.md	#ifdef DEBUG	  if !condition   {  }}Then, you can use the new function as:

google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	We invite people to post results from this test on the followingmailing list:A row hammering attempt involves picking two or more memory locationsand then accessing them, uncached, repeatedly
google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	 If the locations arein different rows of DRAM but in the same bank, this will cause therows to be activated repeatedly
google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	 It is these repeated row activationsthat can cause bit flips in adjacent rows.We use a probabilistic approach for picking memory locations: We cansimply pick random pairs of addresses, and retry repeatedly
google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	 If amachine has 16 banks of DRAM, there should be a 1/16 chance that thetwo addresses chosen map to the same bank
google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	  For example, somemachines that I've tested contain 2 DRAM modules with 8 banks each
google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	This probabilistic approach means that the test doesn't need to knowhow the CPU's memory controller maps physical addresses to DRAM rowand column numbers, and it doesn't need to know the physical addressesof the memory it has allocated.The test allocates a large block of memory
google-readmegoogle-rowhammer-test.md	Mailing list	 It repeatedly picks >2random addresses within the block, hammers them, and then checks theblock for bit flips

google-readmegoogle-rtc-video-quality.md	Generating Graphs	To generate graphs from existing graph data run:This will generate several graph image files under OUT_DIR from data filesgenerated using generate_data.py, where each clip and temporal/spatialconfiguration are grouped together to generate graphs comparing differentencoders and layer performances for separate SSIM, AvgPSNR and GlbPSNRmetrics
google-readmegoogle-rtc-video-quality.md	Generating Graphs	Multiple encoders and codecs are placed in the same graphs to enable acomparison between them.The script also generates graphs for encode time used
google-readmegoogle-rtc-video-quality.md	Generating Graphs	For speed tests it'srecommended to use a SSD or similar, along with a single worker instance tominimize the impact that competing processes and disk/network drive performancehas on time spent encoding._The scripts make heavy use of temporary filespace
google-readmegoogle-rtc-video-quality.md	Generating Graphs	Every worker instance usesdisk space rougly equal to a few copies of the original raw video file that isusually huge to begin with
google-readmegoogle-rtc-video-quality.md	Generating Graphs	To solve or mitigate issues where disk space runsout during graph-data generation, either reduce the amount of workers used with--workers or use another temporary directory  with more space available  bychanging the TMPDIR environment variable._

google-readmegoogle-rtc-video-quality.md	Adding or Updating Encoder Implementations	This requires adding anentry under generate_data.py which handles the new encoder, optionallyincluding support for spatial/temporal configurations.Any improvements upstream to encoder implementations have to be pulled in byupdating pinned revision hashes in corresponding setup/build scripts.
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	rttcp: A Tool To Debug The Performance of a Network Link Using TCP	Copyright 2017 Google Inc.This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	rttcp is a tool to analyze the performance of a network link from a packettrace containing TCP traffic.The main use case is to provide some characterization of the performanceof a link using a tcp performance test  speedtest 
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	Assume you have anetwork whose performance you want to debug  e.g
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	it includes a radiolink 
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	You get a client to access a speedtest service  e.g
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	the Google Fiber Speedtest  This isvery handy, as any device with a browser can do
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	You run your HTMLspeedtest, and get some numbers
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	You also capture the trace at anypoint in the path between your device and the speedtest server.While measuring the performance of a connection by using tcp trafficpresents some issues  it depends on the exact parameters of tcp, likecongestion control, etc
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Introduction	, we can get an idea of how the link isbehaving by checking how the packets go back and forth.
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	rttcp provides 2 analysis modes, namely "flow" and "packet".the "flow" mode provides a per-flow performance analysis
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	Inparticular, it provides 4 graphs:the "packet" mode provides an analysis of per-packet RTT data
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	Wemeasure a TCP segment RTT as the difference between the timestamp ofthe TCP segment, and the timestamp of the first ACK packet that ACKsthe highest SEQ number of the TCP segment.The idea is that the first ACK that acknowledges a full segment isthe first instant where we can be sure that the segment has beenreceived
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	We remove any duplicate data segments to avoid biasing thestatistics with the latency of lost packets.This mode, in fact, measures the time for  a  the  data  segment toreach the receiver,  b  the time for the receiver tcp stack to receiveit and generate an ACK, and  c  the time for the  pure  ACK to reachthe capturing point
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	This provides a nice measurement of theround-trip time performance of the download path from the capturingIn particular, the "packet" mode provides 4 graphs  also known as"deltas" :  function of the timestamp of the TCP segment
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	 delta2: delta2 is similar to delta1, but instead of using the ACK  and SEQ numbers, it uses the TSval and TSecr of the   tcp timestamp option   delta3: delta3 tries to calculate the one-way latency of traffic  by estimating the offset and HZ of the sender
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	 delta4: delta4 measures the inter-packet latency in tcp trains
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	 It defines a train as a set of packets separated no more than a  constant  we use 2 msec for this, as this is the hystart_ack_delta  constant in linux/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c .delta1 and delta2 both measure the time for a segment to go from thecapture point to the client and back
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	delta3 measures the time fromthe client to the capture point.As the data segments can flow in both directions, we provide forseparation of the forward and reverse paths, which are typicallydifferent
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Discussion	We also provide a boxplot of the distribution of thevalues, plus the basic statistics.
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Operation	rttcp.py is a vanilla python file
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Operation	It uses tshark  a CLI version of wireshark  to print some selected fields in thepacket trace
google-readmegoogle-rttcp.md	Operation	It then uses a combination of numpy, pandas, and matplotlibto analyze and graph the results.To get to know the options of the tool, run:usage: rttcp.py  -h   -d   --quiet   -v   --tshark TSHARK   -i INPUT-FILE rttcp flow aggregator.positional arguments:  {help,analyze,plot}optional arguments:  -h, --help  -d, --debug  --quiet  -v, --version  --tshark TSHARK  -i INPUT-FILE, --input INPUT-FILE  -o OUTPUT-FILE, --output OUTPUT-FILE  --type ANALYSIS_TYPE  set the analysis type  flow, packet   --src-reverse SRC-REVERSETo run the "flow" analysis:Figure 2 shows an example of "flow" analysis result.To run the "packet" analysis:Figure 3 shows an example of "packet" analysis result.

google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Schema.org Client Library for Java	The Schema.org Client Library for Java is a library for creating  schema.org  entities.The entities can be easily serialized and deserialized with  JSON-LD format by using the JSON-LD serializer in the library.Note that it is based on a 2016 release snapshot of Schema.org, and is not currently actively being developed
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Schema.org Client Library for Java	If you are interested to see updates  e.g
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Schema.org Client Library for Java	for Schema.org 3.4 or later , please comment in  Issue #7 
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Library Highlights	The library has the following highlights:
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Limitations	Below is a simple example of creating schema.org  Thing object, serialize it into JSON-LD format and deserialize JSON-LD back to a Thing object.Some important usage recommendations are given below:
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Package Structure	The Java Classes are organized into the following pakcages:
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	In the Java library, every schema.org type has a corresponding Java interfacewith the same name as the schema.org type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	The Java interfaces are designed withthe  Builder Pattern  Developersdon't need to know any details about implementation of these interfaces, becauseall the operations on the object will be performed through the interface.CoreFactory and GoogFactory classes provide static factory methods thatreturn a Builder object for a specific schema.org type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	In the builderinterfaces, there are add PropertyName  methods for each property which couldbe set in the corresponding schema.org type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	Multiple values can be added to aproperty as documented by schema.org
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	The build   method should be called tocreate an immutable concrete instance of that type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	A get PropertyName Listmethod is defined for each property
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	The get PropertyName List method willreturn an  ImmutableList containing all the values for the specific property
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Builders	In order to add any customproperty into any schema.org type, the addProperty and getProperty methodsare defined in the interface for each schema.org type.
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	DataType	 DataType  is defined in the packagecom.google.schemaorg.core.datatype
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	DataType	To create a primitive DataType object, thestatic method of   in each type should be used.For example:
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	Subtypes of  Enumeration  are handled slightlydifferently
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	For each Enumeration subtype in schema.org, a Java interface iscreated which provides accessor methods for the properties of that type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	Thename of the interface is the same name as the schema.org type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	In addition, aJava Enum class is also created to hold the enum values of that schema.orgEnumeration type
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	The name of the Enum class is type name with Enum appended.For example,  ActionStatusType  is a subtypeof  Enumeration  in schema.org
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	It has thefollowing values:enum values:All the schema.org type builders also support setting the values for JSON-LDkeywords
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Enumeration	Following methods are defined in the builder interface:
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Serialization	class also has an overloaded convenience method that takes the builder classitself as shown below:serialize List objects .
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Deserialization	JsonLdSerializer serializer = new JsonLdSerializer true /String jsonLd =try {  }} catch  JsonLdSyntaxException e  {  // Errors related to JSON-LD format and schema.org terms in JSON-LD} catch  JsonIOException e  {  // Errors related to JSON formatLimitations of current JSON-LD deserialization are given below:Future versions of this client library may remove these limitations.
google-readmegoogle-schemaorg-java.md	Dependencies	This library depends on following public libraries:repositories {dependencies {
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Schism	Schism is an experimental self-hosting compiler from a subset of R6RS Scheme toThis is not an officially supported Google product.Development so far has focused on features necessary forself-hosting
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Schism	The compiler itself is written in, and compiles, a verysmall subset of Scheme
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Schism	Now that self-hosting has been achieved,development can shift towards supporting a more complete subset ofScheme
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Schism	Just to be clear, by subset we mean that all programssupported by Schism are also legal R6RS Scheme programs and they willhave the same behavior when run under Schism or an R6RS-compliantBesides just being fun, one of the goals of this project is to explore differentways to use WebAssembly
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Schism	This includes implementing garbage collection, possiblyusing the WebAssembly GC proposal, dynamic linking and code generation, etc.Chez Scheme was used to bootstrap, but development no longer relies on anexisting Scheme implementation and can instead run purely based on snapshotschecked into the repository.As mentioned, the goal has been to prioritize features needed for selfhosting
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Schism	Here are some of the current restrictions:See the docs directory for more information about how variousfeatures are implemented.
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Current Status and Next Steps	The compiler is self-hosting! Now the goal is to make a more completelanguage
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Current Status and Next Steps	Some of the big missing features are:it easier to implement them.
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Testing	We currently use a very simple testing protocol
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Testing	The do-test
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Testing	This function can do whatever it wants, but it must return a valueother than #f to pass.To run all the tests, do ./run-tests.sh.
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	The Playground	This repository includes a very simple playground.html, which gives alightweight way to play around with the compiler
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	The Playground	The best way to use it is tostart up a web server  python -m SimpleHTTPServer should work  and point yourbrowser at the page
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	The Playground	Be warned, there is almost no error checking right now, sostrange things can happen.
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	The compiler code all lives in schism/compiler.ss
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	There is a small JavaScriptruntime in rt/rt.mjs
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	The goal is to keep as much code as possible in Scheme,but the runtime is needed to interact with the rest of the world
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	In the future,the runtime should also handle dynamic module loading.We have a staged build system
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	Stage0 is the compiler snapshot, stored inschism-stage0.wasm
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	Stage1 is generated by compiling schism/compiler.ss withthe Stage0 compiler, Stage2 by compiling with the Stage1 compiler, and Stage3 bycompiling with the Stage2 compiler
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	Stage3 should be equal to the Stage2compiler, and currently we only generate it to verify this is the case.To add a new feature, the usual flow is to start by adding a small test thatuses it
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	This test will probably fail at least the Stage0 compiler
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	Once thefeature is implemented, then the Stage1 and Stage2 compilers should pass thetest
google-readmegoogle-schism.md	Development	Note that you cannot use the new feature in the compiler until it works instageOnce this happens, you should make a new snapshot using mksnapshot.sh.

google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Summary	This is a **portable crypto library***secure by design**, for use as a black-box building block in cryptographicprotocols
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Summary	 Security and portability are emphasized over efficient  compact encodings, but keeping the crypto overhead reasonably minimal is still arequirement
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Summary	The API and implementation should encourage the use of bestpractices, and reduce the likelihood of common protocol design errors.
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Existing cryptographic libraries available in most languages typically exposeraw crypto primitives  e.g., block ciphers with modes of operation, HMACs,digital signatures  that are often applied incorrectly in protocol design.While these libraries are "standards compliant", they do little or nothing toguide the protocol designer to produce secure protocol designs
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Worse still,they leave ample room for implementations to introduce subtle security bugssuch as timing attacks.The SecureMessage library leverages Google's protobuffer technology to providea simple and portable encoding for public keys and signed/encrypted data
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Theexposed API consists of two main classes, and two supporting classes.The main classes are:  decryption, and sanity checking in a secure fashionThe supporting classes are:  reject maliciously crafted inputs  e.g., EC public keys that are not on the  curve 
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Also assists with key generation
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	 in the case of HKDF, providing clients of the library with access a portable  API for that primitive too, since it is not commonly available .In all cases, exposed APIs are carefully thought out, in order to encouragesafe use and prevent unsafe use
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	For example, the SecureMessageParser API willnot return the original input data unless the signature on it has been verifiedfirst
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	It also requires the caller to specify exactly which signature algorithmis expected to be used, to prevent callers from accidentally consuming messagessent using any other  potentially deprecated / insecure  signature algorithms.Currently supported signature algorithms are:The basic API for SecureMessage consists of two classes, one of which createsSecureMessages, whereas the other parses them
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	 There are two basic types ofSecureMessage which these classes manipulate:  may be either a digital signature, or a MAC
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	 are taken to ensure that the original signature cannot be stripped off of the  encrypted data and replaced by another signature from a different signer
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Note that we use the term "signature" in a generic sense, to refer to eitherdigital signatures  using asymmetric keys  or Message Authentication Codes using symmetric keys 
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Currently, the encryption component of signcryptedmessages only supports symmetric key encryption schemes, but this may change inthe future.Each SecureMessage consists of two primary components: a header and a body.The header describes the structure of the SecureMessage as well as providing aconvenient location for metadata related to the body
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	The body of theSecureMessage will contain the primary payload
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Rather than using the protobufAPIs to retrieve these components from a SecureMessage, the SecureMessageParsermust be used
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	The header component is always sent in the clear, and can beextracted from the SecureMessage by calling SecureMessageParser'sgetUnverifiedHeader   method without the use of any cryptographic keys
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	Thus,it is possible to use the header contents to determine which key s  must beused to verify  and possibly decrypt  the body
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	 In order to retrieve the bodycomponent, an appropriate call must be made to SecureMessageParser'sparseSignedCleartextMessage   or parseSigncryptedMessage   method, depending onwhich of the two message types was sent.To provide better support for building cryptographic protocols, we also providea utility class called PublicKeyProtoUtil that assists with encoding andparsing public keys in a simple wire format, as well as generating new keypairs
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Overview	In particular, this class can be used to dramatically simplifyDiffie-Hellman key exchanges.
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	There is a some excess overhead incurred for using this library, as compared toa more "direct" implementation of almost any of the offered functionality
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	Theexcess overhead is the price being paid for simplicity and robustness, both inthe API and in the implementation
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	If saving every CPU cycle or every bit ofbandwidth is of crucial importance to you, do not use this library  forexample, it would not make for a good SSL replacement for high volume traffic .To get a sense for magnitude of the SecureMessage overhead, a symmetric keybased HMAC SHA-256 and AES-256 CBC mode authenticated encryption incurs amaximum of about 80 bytes of overhead with SecureMessage, as opposed to amaximum of about 64 bytes of overhead using a direct implementation of the sameEncryption without signature is intentionally unsupported
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	Historically,offering encryption-only APIs has lead to a plethora of mistakes in protocoldesign and implementation, since it is frequently assumed that encrypted datacannot be tampered with  but this is not the case in practice .Support for public key encryption is not yet available, although it may beadded in the future
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	Instead, we recommend to design protocols that use EC Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, and then used the exchanged symmetric key forencryption
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	For instance, this approach can offer forward secrecy, andincreased efficiency when multiple messages are concerned
google-readmegoogle-securemessage.md	Caveats	 Note that it iseasy to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman keys using a signature-onlySecureMessage wrapping with a public key signature scheme.

google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Seesaw v2	 ! GoDoc  Note: This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	About	Seesaw v2 is a Linux Virtual Server  LVS  based load balancing platform.It is capable of providing basic load balancing for servers that are on thesame network, through to advanced load balancing functionality such as anycast,Direct Server Return  DSR , support for multiple VLANs and centralisedAbove all, it is designed to be reliable and easy to maintain.
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Requirements	A Seesaw v2 load balancing cluster requires two Seesaw nodes physical machines or virtual instances
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Requirements	Each node must have two networkinterfaces four interfaces should be connected to the same layer 2 network.
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Building	Seesaw v2 is developed in Go and depends on several Go packages: libnl  and a compile time dependency onthe Go protobuf compiler.On a Debian/Ubuntu style system, you should be able to prepare for buildingby running:If your distro has a go version before 1.5, you may need to fetch a newerrelease from After setting GOPATH to an appropriate location  for example ~/go :Ensure that ${GOPATH}/bin is in your ${PATH} and in the seesaw directory:If you wish to regenerate the protobuf code, the protobuf compiler and Goprotobuf compiler generator are also needed:The protobuf code can then be regenerated with:
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Installing	After make install has run successfully, there should be a number ofbinaries in ${GOPATH}/bin with a seesaw_ prefix
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Installing	Install these to theappropriate locations:The setcap binary can be found in the libcap2-bin package on Debian/Ubuntu.
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Configuring	Each node needs a /etc/seesaw/seesaw.cfg configuration file, which providesinformation about the node and who its peer is
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Configuring	Additionally, each loadbalancing cluster needs a cluster configuration, which is in the form of atext-based protobuf An example seesaw.cfg file can be found in etc/seesaw/seesaw.cfg.example  etc/seesaw/seesaw.cfg.example  seesaw.cfg provides the following:master
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Configuring	This address needs to be allocated within the same netblock as boththe node IP address and peer IP address.An example cluster.pb file can be found in etc/seesaw/cluster.pb.example  etc/seesaw/cluster.pb.example  cluster.pb contains a seesaw_vip entry and two node entries
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Configuring	For eachservice that you want to load balance, a separate vserver entry isneeded, with one or more vserver_entry sections  one per port/proto pair ,one or more backends and one or more healthchecks
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Configuring	Further informationis available in the protobuf definition  pb/config/config.proto  pb/config/config.proto .On an upstart based system, running restart seesaw_watchdog will start  orrestart  the watchdog process, which will in turn start the other components.
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Anycast	Seesaw v2 provides full support for anycast VIPs an anycast VIP when it becomes available and will withdraw the anycast VIP ifit becomes unavailable
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Anycast	For this to work the Quagga BGP daemon needs to beinstalled and configured, with the BGP peers accepting host-specific routesthat are advertised from the Seesaw nodes within the anycast range  currentlyhardcoded as 192.168.255.0/24 .
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Command Line	Once initial configuration has been performed and the Seesaw components arerunning, the state of the Seesaw can be viewed and controlled via the Seesawcommand line interface
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Command Line	Running seesaw  assuming /usr/bin is in your path will give you an interactive prompt commands
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Command Line	A quick summary:A Seesaw should have five components that are running under the watchdog process table should show processes for:provided by the watchdog
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Command Line	If any of the processes are not running, check thecorresponding logs in /var/log/seesaw  e.g
google-readmegoogle-seesaw.md	Command Line	seesaw_engine.{log,INFO} .

License  SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly forNeural Network-based text generation systems where the vocabulary sizeis predetermined prior to the neural model training
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	SentencePiece	SentencePiece implements**subword units***unigram language model*with the extension of direct training from raw sentences
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	SentencePiece	SentencePiece allows us to make a purely end-to-end system that does not depend on language-specific pre/postprocessing.**This is not an official Google product.**

google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	What is SentencePiece?	SentencePiece is a re-implementation of **sub-word units**, an effective way to alleviate the open vocabulary  problems in neural machine translation
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	What is SentencePiece?	SentencePiece supports two segmentation algorithms, **byte-pair-encoding  BPE *
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	The number of unique tokens is predetermined	Neural Machine Translation models typically operate with a fixedvocabulary
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	The number of unique tokens is predetermined	Unlike most unsupervised word segmentation algorithms, whichassume an infinite vocabulary, SentencePiece trains the segmentation model suchthat the final vocabulary size is fixed, e.g., 8k, 16k, or 32k.Note that SentencePices specifies the final vocabulary size for training, which is different from  subword-nmt  that uses the number of merge operations.The number of merge operations is a BPE-specific parameter and not applicable to other segmentation algorithms, including unigram, word and character.
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Trains from raw sentences	Previous sub-word implementations assume that the input sentences are pre-tokenized
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Trains from raw sentences	This constraint was required for efficient training, but makes the preprocessing complicated as we have to run language dependent tokenizers in advance.The implementation of SentencePiece is fast enough to train the model from raw sentences
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Trains from raw sentences	This is useful for training the tokenizer and detokenizer for Chinese, Japanese and Korean where no explicit spaces exist between words.
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	The first step of Natural Language processing is text tokenization
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	Forexample, a standard English tokenizer would segment the text "Hello world." into thefollowing three tokens.>  Hello   World   
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	One observation is that the original input and tokenized sequence are **NOTreversibly convertible**
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	For instance, the information that is no space between“World” and “.” is dropped from the tokenized sequence, since e.g., Tokenize “World.”  == Tokenize “World .” SentencePiece treats the input text just as a sequence of Unicode characters
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	Whitespace is also handled as a normal symbol
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	To handle the whitespace as a basic token explicitly, SentencePiece first escapes the whitespace with a meta symbol "▁"  U+2581  as follows.> Hello▁World.Then, this text is segmented into small pieces, for example:>  Hello   ▁Wor   ld   
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	Since the whitespace is preserved in the segmented text, we can detokenize the text without any ambiguities.Note that we cannot apply the same lossless conversions when splitting thesentence with standard word segmenters, since they treat the whitespace as aspecial symbol
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	Tokenized sequences do not preserve the necessary information to restore the original sentence.Subword regularization   Kudo
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	  is a simple regularization methodthat virtually augments training data with on-the-fly subword sampling, which helps to improve the accuracy as well as robustness of NMT models.To enable subword regularization, you would like to integrate SentencePiece library   C++  doc/api.md#sampling-subword-regularization / Python  python/README.md   into the NMT system to sample one segmentation for each parameter update, which is different from the standard off-line data preparations
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	Here's the example of  Python library  python/README.md 
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	You can find that 'New York' is segmented differently on each SampleEncode call
google-readmegoogle-sentencepiece.md	Whitespace is treated as a basic symbol	The details of sampling parameters are found in  sentencepiece_processor.h  src/sentencepiece_processor.h .

google-readmegoogle-serialization.dart.md	General serialization for Dart objects.	It can handlecycles, inheritance, getters and setters, private or final fields setvia constructors, objectsserialized in different ways at different times, and other complexoptions
google-readmegoogle-serialization.dart.md	General serialization for Dart objects.	It can handle serializing acyclic objects with only publicfields to a simple JSON format, but might be more heavyweight than isnecessary if that's the only requirement.This has no privileged access to object representations, so objectsare accessed and created according to their public APIs
google-readmegoogle-serialization.dart.md	General serialization for Dart objects.	As a result,serializations from older versions where the internal representationhas changed can still be read as long as the public API is still available.The way an object's state is read and written is defined bySerializationRules

google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Introduction	This project is a library for fully-homomorphic symmetric-key encryption
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Introduction	Ituses Ring Learning with Errors  RLWE -based encryption to make it possible toboth add and multiply encrypted data
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Introduction	It uses modulus-switching to enablearbitrary-depth homomorphic encryption  provided sufficiently large parametersare set 
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Introduction	RLWE is also believed to be secure in the face of quantum computers.This library is designed to be compact and readable
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Introduction	The library includes just1500 lines of heavily-commented source  700 lines of source, 600 lines ofcomments and 200 blank lines  and 900 lines of unit tests.We intend this project to be both a useful experimental library and acomprehensible tool for learning about and extending RLWE.Discussion group: **THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL GOOGLE PRODUCT**
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Fully Homomorphic Encryption	Fully homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that makes it possible toperform arbitrary computation on encrypted data.For example, suppose that Alice creates a secret key *sencrypt the numbers *2*{3}s*
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Fully Homomorphic Encryption	In an *additively homomorphicdoes not know the numbers inside the ciphertexts  could add the ciphertextstogether, generating the message *{5}s5 , or multiply the ciphertexts together, generating the messageresulting message remain hidden to Bob
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Fully Homomorphic Encryption	When he gives this result back to Alice,however, she can decrypt it to reveal the result of the computation.When an encryption scheme is both additively and multiplicatively homomorphic,it is said to be *fully homomorphic*.Homomorphic encryption has a vast number of applications
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Fully Homomorphic Encryption	As in the exampleabove, Alice can securely offload computation to another entity without worryingthat doing so will reveal any of her private information
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Fully Homomorphic Encryption	Among many otherapplications, it enables *private information retrievalcan serve user requests without learning which pieces of data the usersrequested
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Fully Homomorphic Encryption	 For more information on PIR, see  XPIR: Private InformationRetrieval for Everyone 
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Ring Learning with Errors	The homomorphic encryption scheme that this library implements is based off ofthe Ring Learning with Errors problem
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Ring Learning with Errors	The security of this system derives fromthe conjectured difficulty of finding the shortest vector in a lattice
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Ring Learning with Errors	Thisdocument does not delve into the mathematical underpinnings of these proofs ofThe cryptosystem implemented in this library is from  Fully HomomorphicEncryption from Ring-LWE and Security for Key DependentMessages The cryptosystem works as follows:
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Preliminaries	Each object in the cryptosystems, including keys, messages, and ciphertexts, aremade of polynomials
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Preliminaries	Each of these polynomials has degree *n-1*, where *npower of In other words, each of these polynomials has *nEach of the coefficients of these polynomials is an integer  mod *q* , where *qwe do so  mod *xn+1* .We also need a modulus *tof bits of plaintext information we are able to fit into each coefficient of aciphertext polynomial
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Preliminaries	The importance of *tFinally, we need two other components: a Gaussian distribution *Yand standard deviation *w*, where *wimportance of this distribution will become apparent soon.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Key Generation	A secret key *sdistribution *Y*.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Encryption	A message *mcoefficients, each of which is smaller than *t*.To encrypt *mfrom the ciphertext.The ciphertext consists of two polynomials
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Encryption	The first polynomial*c0 = as + m + et*
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Encryption	The second polynomial *c1 = -a*
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Encryption	Theproducts between polynomials are computed using polynomial multiplications  mod*xn+1* .
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Decryption	Given a ciphertext * c0, c1 *, the ciphertext is decryptedby computing *mwas already  mod *t* .
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Homomorphic Addition	To add two ciphertexts, simply add them component-wise
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Homomorphic Addition	If we added theciphertexts * c0x, c1x c1y *, we would get the ciphertext * c0x + c0y,c1x + c1y ext + ays + my + eyt,-ax  mx - ax + ay  *.If we let *az*ex + ey*, the resulting ciphertext is * azs +mz + ezt, -az *, which is just anotherciphertext encrypting the sum of the original messages.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Homomorphic Absorbtion	We can multiply a ciphertext containing the message *mpolynomial *pmultiply the components of the ciphertext by *p*: * cxp,c1p containing the message *mpchanged to *ap*.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Homomorphic Multiplication	Adding homomorphic multiplication to this library requires small tweaks to theaforementioned operations.To multiply two ciphertexts * c0x, c1x * c0y, c1y *, compute their cross product:* c0xc0y, c1xc0y +c0xc1y, c1xc1y *.Notice that the resulting ciphertext has three components, not the usual two.This is perfectly acceptable and all the aforementioned operations will work asbefore with small modifications:
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	Observe that, after each homomorphic operation, the error in the resultingciphertext grows
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	When adding, it grows additively, where in absorption andmultiplication it grows exponentially
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	When the largest coefficient ofpolynomial that results from taking the inner product of the ciphertext vector* c0, c1, ..
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	* s0, s1, ..
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	up and decryption will fail.As you choose the parameters for your particular application, you will need totrace the growth of the sum of the error and the message carefully.One way of managing error is to set a larger modulus
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	Setting a larger modulusmust be done with care, however
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	Security of RLWE derives partly from the ratioof modulus to error
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Error Growth	If the modulus increases in size, so must the standarddeviation of the error distirbution.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	Modulus switching is a strategy to slow the rate of error growth when performingmany levels of homomorphic multiplications
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	The explanation and implementationof this technique in this library derives from  Fully Homomorphic Encryptionwithout Bootstrapping Modulus switching takes a ciphertext converts a ciphertext from a larger modulusto a smaller modulus
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	Specifically, when converting from modulus *q*r*, each coefficient of the ciphertext *kqdivided by *q*, and rounded to the nearest integer, producing *kr*.This value is then shifted up or down the minimum amount to ensure thatciphertext will decrypt properly
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	When modulus switching, the error will scalewith the shift in the modulus, keeping the modulus-to-error ratio constant.To understand the benefit of modulus switching, consider the following example.Suppose four ciphertexts initially each have error *e*
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	After homomorphicallymultiplying them in pairs, we will have two ciphertexts each with error*O e2 *
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	When multiplying those two ciphertexts, the resulting errorwill be *O e4 *
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	In other words, when multiplying ciphertextstogether, the exponent of the error will grow exponentially.Modulus switching offers a way to reduce the complexity of the error growth.After computing two ciphertexts each with error *x2*, we shift frommodulus *q*x*
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	The modulus-to-error ratio is the same as before
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	Were we to convert backto modulus *q*, the error would return to its original value
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Modulus Switching	When we multiplythese ciphertexts again, the overall error will be *x2Were we to convert back to the original modulus, the overall error would be*x3*, dramatically smaller than without modulus switching.This library has the ability to perform modulus switching.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	This Library	This library consists of four major components that form a RLWE stack.
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Montgomery Integers	This library is implemented in montgomery.h
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Montgomery Integers	At the lowest level is a librarythat represents modular integers in Montgomery form, which speeds up therepeated use of the modulo operator
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Montgomery Integers	This library supports 64-bit integers,meaning that it can support a modulus of up to 30-bits
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Montgomery Integers	For larger modulussizes, the higher levels of the stack can be parameterized with a different type such as a BigInteger 
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Montgomery Integers	Montgomery integers require several parameters inaddition to the modulus to perform the modular operations efficiently
google-readmegoogle-shell-encryption.md	Montgomery Integers	Thesevalues have been chosen for several common moduli in constants.h.

google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	skicka	Utility for working with files and folders stored on Google Drive.Note: skicka is not an official Google product!
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Intro	skicka makes it easy to copy files to and from Google Drive and to work withfiles stored on Google Drive.For example, skicka upload ~/Pictures /Pictures copies the entirecontents of the local ~/Pictures directory to a folder Pictures inGoogle Drive
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Intro	If you then run skicka download /Pictures ~/Pictures2,then the contents of your ~/Pictures2 directory will match the contentsof ~/Pictures.More generally, skicka makes it easy to list the files in Google Drivefolders, compute the space used by Drive folders, and copy files betweenyour computer to Google Drive
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Intro	 If you'd like to encrypt your files beforeuploading them, skicka supports AES-256 encryption.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	What skicka is not	skicka is not a general solution for automatically synchronizing filesstored in Google Drive across multiple machines
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	What skicka is not	In particular, it doesn'thave logic to reconcile concurrent changes to the same file on differentFurthermore, although skicka has been robust in usage so far and hasno known data corruption bugs, it should for now be treated as "alpha"software
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	What skicka is not	 Bug reports are welcome.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Getting Started	You must have a  Go  compiler installed.Download and build skicka: go get github.com/google/skickaEither copy the skicka executable in $GOPATH/bin to a directory inRun skicka init to create a skeleton ~/.skicka.config file
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Getting Started	VariousAuthorize skicka to access your Google Drive files: run skicka ls,After skicka is authorized, it will download and locally cacheIf you're going store encrypted files in Google Drive, create anTry it out: run skicka ls -l /
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Getting Started	A list of the files and foldersJoin the  mailing list 
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	For a general overview of skicka's commands, run skicka help.To copy a local directory hierarchy to Google Drive, use the uploadcommand
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	 As the upload progresses, skicka periodically reports howmuch data has been uploaded and how much time has elapsed.above in "Getting Started" and then use the SKICKA_PASSPHRASE environment variable; thus, you might use:download
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	As the download progresses, status is periodically reported:Drive
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	For example, after uploading your ~/Pictures directory, you mightand the local modification time that the file on Google Drive is syncedto
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	The file permissions are based on the permissions of the file when itwas uploaded to Google Drive
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	For even more detail, ls -ll can be used, which also prints the MD5checksums of the files on Google Drive
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	The contents of a single file can be downloaded using cat:command, the -p option can be specified to indicate that the intermediatedirectories in the path should be created .Drive folder can be reported by du:in Google Drive:use the -s command-line option to rm
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Usage	 To remove a folder andeverything inside it, use -r.Finally, there is a fsck command that checks the file system on GoogleDrive for problems and verifies that the local cache of file metadata isin-sync with the files stored on Drive.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Can skicka work with Google Drive files that it didn't create itself?	Yes
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Can skicka work with Google Drive files that it didn't create itself?	 The only limitations are that regular Google Drive files don't storethe Unix permissions or the local modification of the original file when itwas uploaded
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Can skicka work with Google Drive files that it didn't create itself?	 Therefore, in this case skicka download uses 644permissions for files it creates and 755 permissions for directories.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	skicka ls -l indicates that a file has world-readable permissions on Google Drive; does this mean anyone can access it?	No
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	skicka ls -l indicates that a file has world-readable permissions on Google Drive; does this mean anyone can access it?	 Those permissions are only used to set the local file permissions whenthe file is downloaded with skicka download
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	skicka ls -l indicates that a file has world-readable permissions on Google Drive; does this mean anyone can access it?	The access permissions forthe files stored on Drive are handled with Drive's regular mechanisms.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	How can I speed up uploads?	There's a fixed per-file overhead for each file uploaded to Google Drivethat limits skicka to creating roughly five files a second; if files arerelatively small, this overhead will be more of a limit than the time spenttransferring the contents of the files.If the uploaded files don't need to be accessed individually, creating atar or zip archive of them before uploading may help in this case.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	I occasionally see "operation timed out" or "broken pipe" errors when uploading; what's going on?	A variety of transient errors can happen when using RESTful APIs like theGoogle Drive API
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	I occasionally see "operation timed out" or "broken pipe" errors when uploading; what's going on?	 When these errors are encountered, skicka makes a numberof attempts to retry the operation before giving up.It may be that skicka should make more attempts before giving up or that there arebetter error handling strategies; one trade-off is that if there is aserious error  like the internet connection is lost , then it's useful forthe user to know this sooner rather than later.If you do see these errors, re-run the operation you were performing; anyfiles that weren't transferred the first time should be taken care of witha second run.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Does skicka support rate-limited uploads and downloads?	Yes
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Does skicka support rate-limited uploads and downloads?	By default, skicka doesn't try to limit its bandwidth usage
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Does skicka support rate-limited uploads and downloads?	 However,if you add a line  download  section of your .skicka.config file, you can specify amaximum number of bytes per second to transfer for uploads or downloads,If this line isn't present  or has a value of zero , then bandwidth won'tbe limited.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Can an http proxy be used with skicka?	Yes--just set the HTTP_PROXY environment variable appropriately.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	"skicka"?!?	Swedish, "to send".
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	How files are stored in Google Drive	When a directory hierarchy is uploaded, Google Drive file is created foreach local file and a Google Drive folder is created for each localdirectory
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	How files are stored in Google Drive	skicka stores the time the local copy file was last modified inthe "modifiedDate" Google Drive File resource
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	How files are stored in Google Drive	 The Unix file permissionsof the file or directory are stored in using a custom "Permissions" fileproperty, stored as a string with the octal file permissions.See the discussion of encryption below for details about how encryptedfiles are represented.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	When deciding if a local file needs to be uploaded to Google Drive,skicka performs the following checks.If there is no corresponding file on Drive, the local file will be uploaded.Otherwise, if there is a corresponding file on Drive and the sizes of the filesare different, the local file will be uploaded.Otherwise, if the local file's modification time is after the modification time ofthe file the last time it was synced to Drive, then an MD5 checksum of thefile contents is computed
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	If this checksum differs from the checksum ofthe file stored on Google Drive, the file will be uploaded
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	 Thus, iftouch is run on a file to update its modification time but thefile's contents aren't modified, skicka won't unnecessarily re-uploadthe file
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	Note that skicka trusts that file modification times are meaningful: if afile's contents are modified leaving the file size is unchanged and if themodification time is set to be in the past, then skicka won't compute anMD5 checksum and won't know that the file should be uploaded
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	To overridethis behavior, run skicka upload with the -ignore-times flag; if thisflag is provided, then the MD5 checksum check in the third step will beapplied regardless of the file modification time.Note also that this algorithm is an algorithm to efficiently mirror thecontents of a set of local files on Google Drive; it's not a generalbidirectional synchronization algorithm
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	 For example, if a file ismodified both on Drive and on the local filesystem, a skicka upload runwill clobber the file contents on Drive
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	In other words, the assumption isthat the source directory hierarchy is by definition the canonical one andthe destination directory's role is to perfectly reflect the source.When downloading from Google Drive, skicka follows the same generalapproach: only files that don't yet exist, have different sizes, ordifferent MD5 checksums from the corresponding local file will bedownloaded
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Synchronization algorithm	The -ignore-times option can also be used to bypass the filemodification time check and to force a comparison of file contents todecide whether to download.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Encryption	If the -encrypt flag is provided to the upload command, skicka willencrypt the contents of each file before uploading it to Google Drive.Conversely, the download and cat commands transparently decryptencrypted files when downloading them  if the encryption key and passphraseare available! Encryption requires both an encryption key and a passphrase; yourpassphrase should be stored in the SKICKA_PASSPHRASE environmentvariable
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Encryption	 To generate an encryption key, run skicka genkey
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Encryption	For example:encryption key; to save your key, edit your ~/.skicka.config file and addthe printed text to the  encryption  section of the file
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Encryption	 You can nowupload and encrypt files:data is lost forever.*this information.skicka only encrypts file contents: it doesn't encrypt filenames or hidefile sizes, for example
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Encryption	 If this is problematic for your usage, you shouldprobably use tar or zip to put the files you want to encrypt into asingle file before uploading it.
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	When skicka genkey is executed, an encryption key is generated asskicka generates a random 32-byte salt using Go's rand.Reader  which returnscryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	The hex-encoded salt isprinted out, and should be recorded in the encrypted-key-iv configuration file field.The encryption key from #4 is encrypted using the initialization vectorfrom #5, using the second 32 bytes of the hash computed in #2 as theencryption key
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	 The result should be copied to the encrypted-key fieldof the config file.Upon subsequent runs of skicka, the salt is loaded from the config fileso that PBKDF2 can be used as in #2 above to hash the user's passphrase
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	Ifthe first 32 bytes of the passphrase hash match the stored bytes, then thesecond 32 bytes of the hash and the stored IV are used to decrypt theencrypted encryption key.Given the encryption key, when a file is to be encrypted before beinguploaded to Google Drive, skicka uses the key along with a fresh16-byte initialization vector for each file to encrypt the file usingAES- The initialization vector is prepended to the file contentsbefore upload
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	 Thus, encrypted files are 16 bytes larger on Google Drivethan they are locally
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	The initialization vector is also stored hex-encoded as a Google Drive fileProperty with the name "IV"
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	We store the initialization vector redundantlyso that if one downloads the encrypted file contents, it's possible todecrypt the file using the file contents  and the key!   alone
google-readmegoogle-skicka.md	Key generation and storage	Conversely,also having the IV available in a property makes it possible to encrypt thecontents of a local version of a file without needing to download any ofthe contents of the corresponding file from Google Drive.
google-readmegoogle-skylark.md	Skylark in Go	This is the home of the _Skylark in Go_ project.Skylark in Go is an interpreter for Skylark, implemented in Go.Skylark is a dialect of Python intended for use as a configuration language.Like Python, it is an untyped dynamic language with high-level datatypes, first-class functions with lexical scope, and garbage collection.Unlike CPython, independent Skylark threads execute in parallel, soSkylark workloads scale well on parallel machines.Skylark is a small and simple language with a familiar and highlyreadable syntax
google-readmegoogle-skylark.md	Skylark in Go	You can use it as an expressive notation forstructured data, defining functions to eliminate repetition, or youcan use it to add scripting capabilities to an existing application.A Skylark interpreter is typically embedded within a largerapplication, and the application may define additional domain-specificfunctions and data types beyond those provided by the core language.For example, Skylark was originally developed for the Bazel build tool Bazel uses Skylark as the notation both for its BUILD files  likeMakefiles, these declare the executables, libraries, and tests in adirectory  and for  its macrolanguage through which Bazel is extended with custom logic to support newlanguages and compilers.

google-readmegoogle-sling.md	SLING 	  SLING is a parser for annotating text with frame semantic annotations
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	SLING 	It istrained on an annotated corpus using  Tensorflow and  Dragnn The parser is a general transition-based frame semantic parser usingbi-directional LSTMs for input encoding and a Transition Based Recurrent Unit TBRU  for output decoding
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	SLING 	It is a jointly trained model using only the texttokens as input and the transition system has been designed to output framegraphs directly without any intervening symbolic representation.! SLING neural network architecture
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	SLING 	 ./doc/report/network.svg The SLING framework includes an efficient and scalable frame storeimplementation as well as a neural network JIT compiler for fast parsing atA more detailed description of the SLING parser can be found in this paper:This is SEMPAR, the first generation of the SLING parser
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	SLING 	We have started to work on CASPAR, the second generation of the parser, which can be found  here 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Trying out the parser	If you just want to try out the parser on a pre-trained model, you can installthe wheel with pip and download a pre-trained parser model
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Trying out the parser	On a Linux machinewith Python 2.7 you can install a pre-built wheel:import slingparser = sling.Parser "sempar.flow" text = raw_input "text: " doc = parser.parse text print doc.frame.data pretty=True for m in doc.mentions:  print "mention", doc.phrase m.begin, m.end 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Installation	First, make sure that the repository is cloned with --recursive, so that youget all the submodules.distribution of Tensorflow, so this needs to be installed
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Installation	The installed versionof protocol buffers needs to match the version used by Tensorflow
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Installation	Finally,SLING uses  Bazel  as the build system, so you need toinstall Bazel in order to build the SLING parser.Operating system: LinuxLanguages: C++ 11  GCC 4 and above , Python 2.7, assemblerCPU: Intel x64 or compatibleBuild system: BazelYou can test your installation by building a few important targets.includes, try the following:Training a new model consists of preparing the commons store and the trainingdata, specifying various options and hyperparameters in the training script,and tracking results as training progresses
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Installation	These are described below in
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Data preparation	The first step consists of preparing the commons store  also called global store 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Data preparation	This has frame andschema definitions for all types and roles of interest, e.g./saft/person or /pb/love-01 or /pb/arg0
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Data preparation	In order to build the commons storefor the OntoNotes-based parser you need to checkout PropBank in a directoryparallel to the SLING directory:Next, write a converter to convert documents in your existing format to SLING documents  sling/nlp/document/document.h 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Data preparation	A SLING document is just adocument frame of type /s/document
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Data preparation	An example of such a frame in textual encodingcan be seen below
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Data preparation	It is best to create one SLING document per input sentence.For writing your converter or getting a better hold of the concepts of frames and store in SLING, you can have a look at detailed deep dive on frames and stores  here  sling/frame/README.md .The SLING  Document class  sling/nlp/document/document.h also has methods to incrementally make such document frames, e.g.Store global;// Read global store from a file via LoadStore  .// Lookup handles in advance.Handle h_person = global.Lookup "/saft/person" ;Handle h_love01 = global.Lookup "/pb/love-01" ;Handle h_arg0 = global.Lookup "/pb/arg0" ;Handle h_arg1 = global.Lookup "/pb/arg1" ;// Prepare the document.Store store &global ;Document doc &store ;  // empty document// Add token information.doc.SetText "John loves Mary" ;doc.AddToken 0, 4, "John", 0 ;doc.AddToken 5, 10, "loves", 1 ;doc.AddToken 11, 15, "Mary", 1 ;// Create frames that will eventually be evoked.Builder b1 &store ;b1.AddIsA h_person ;Frame john_frame = b1.Create  ;Builder b2 &store ;b2.AddIsA h_person ;Frame mary_frame = b2.Create  ;Builder b3 &store ;b3.AddIsA h_love01 ;b3.Add h_arg0, john_frame ;b3.Add h_arg1, mary_frame ;Frame love_frame = b3.Create  ;
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Add spans and evoke frames from them.	doc.AddSpan 0, 1 ->Evoke john_frame ;doc.AddSpan 1, 2 ->Evoke love_frame ;doc.AddSpan 2, 3 ->Evoke mary_frame ;doc.Update  ;string encoded = Encode doc.top   ;// Write 'encoded' to a zip stream or a file.Use the converter to create the following corpora:+ Training corpus of annotated SLING documents.+ Dev corpus of annotated SLING documents
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Add spans and evoke frames from them.	 per document, and the file for a document is just its encoded document  frame
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Add spans and evoke frames from them.	An alternate format is to have a folder with one file per  document
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Add spans and evoke frames from them.	More formats can be added by modifying the reader code here  and  here 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Specify training options and hyperparameters:	Once the commons store and the corpora have been built, you are ready for traininga model
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Specify training options and hyperparameters:	For this, use the supplied  training script  sling/nlp/parser/tools/train.sh .The script provides various commandline arguments
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Specify training options and hyperparameters:	The ones that specifythe input data are:+ --commons: File path of the commons store built in the previous step.+ --train: Path to the training corpus built in the previous step.+ --dev: Path to the annotated dev corpus built in the previous step.+ --output or --output_dir: Output folder where checkpoints, master spec,  temporary files, and the final model will be saved.Then we have the various training options and hyperparameters:+ --oov_features: Whether fallback lexical features should be used in the LSTMs.+ --word_embeddings: Empty, or path to pretrained word embeddings in   Mikolov's word2vec format   If supplied, these are used to initialize the embeddings for word features.+ --word_embeddings_dim: Dimensionality of embeddings for word features
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Specify training options and hyperparameters:	 Should be the same as the pretrained embeddings, if they are supplied.+ --batch: Batch size used during training.+ --report_every: Checkpoint interval.+ --train_steps: Number of training steps.+ --method: Optimization method to use  e.g
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Specify training options and hyperparameters:	adam or momentum , along  with auxiliary arguments like --adam_beta1, --adam_beta2, --adam_eps.+ --dropout_keep_rate: Probability of keeping after dropout during  training , so --dropout_keep_rate=1.0 means nothing is dropped.+ --learning_rate: Learning rate.+ --decay: Decay steps.+ --grad_clip_norm: Max norm beyond which gradients will be clipped.+ --moving_average: Whether or not to use exponential moving average.+ --seed, --seed2: Randomization seeds used for initializing embedding matrices.The script comes with reasonable defaults for the hyperparameters fortraining a semantic parser model, but it would be a good idea to hardcodeyour favorite arguments  directly in thescript to avoid supplying them again and again on the commandline.
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	To test your training setup, you can kick off a small training run:This training run should be over in 10-20 minutes, and should checkpoint andevaluate after every 500 steps
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	For a full-training run, we suggest increasingthe number of steps to something like 100,000 and decreasing the checkpointfrequency to something like every 2000-5000 steps.As training proceeds, the training script produces a lot of usefuldiagnostic information, which we describe below
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 The table and its summary are dumped in $OUTPUT_FOLDER/{table,  table.summary}, and this path is logged by the script in its output
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 For example, here is the action table summary for the  semantic parsing model included in this release:    ===================================================  Action Type || Unique Arg Combinations || Raw Count  ===================================================  ===================================================      completely specifies the configuration of the two LSTMs and the feed forward  unit, including the features used by each component, and the dimensions of  the various embeddings
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 then you would have to modify the  MasterSpec generation code   and add any new feature definitions  here   and/or  here  Recall however that  --word_embeddings_dim, --pretrained_embeddings, and --oov_features  allow you to do some of this directly from the commandline
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 being dumped at $OUTPUT_FOLDER/master_spec as a textualized protocol  buffer, so you can visually check whether the configuration looks good or not
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 will finish here
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	This is useful for first ascertaining that the spec and  action table look right, particularly while debugging or running a new  training setup for the first time
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 that it's creating a log directory for running  Tensorboard   Wrote events  incl
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	graph  for Tensorboard to folder: /my/output/folder/tensorboard  The graph can be viewed via  tensorboard --logdir=/my/output/folder/tensorboard  then navigating to  and clicking on 'GRAPHS'    training, particularly the evaluation metrics at various checkpoints
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 It also allows you to view the Tensorflow graph used for training
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 shell  INFO:tensorflow:Initial cost at step 0: 2.949682  INFO:tensorflow:cost at step 100: 1.218417  INFO:tensorflow:cost at step 200: 0.991216  INFO:tensorflow:cost at step 300: 0.838045      After every checkpoint interval  specified via --report_every ,  it will save the model and evaluate it on the dev corpus
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 The evaluation runs a  graph matching algorithm  sling/nlp/parser/trainer/frame-evaluation.h   that outputs various metrics from aligning the gold frame graph  vs the test frame graph
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	If you are looking for a single number to  quantify your model, then we suggest using **SLOT_F1**, which aggregates across  frame type and role accuracies  i.e
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	both node and edge alignment scores 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 it with an extrinsic evaluation, then just replace the binary   here  with your evaluation binary
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	 different training options without really wanting to change the spec,  or the action table, or any lexical resources
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	For this, use the  --train_only commandline argument
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	This will initiate training from  the Tensorflow graph generation step, and will use the pre-generated spec  etc
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Run the training script	from the same output folder.We have made a synthetic training and evaluation corpus available for trying out the parser
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Parsing	The trained parser model is stored in a  Myelin  sling/myelin/README.md  flow file,e.g
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Parsing	sempar.flow
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Parsing	It contains all the information needed for parsing text:A pre-trained model can be download from  here The model can be loaded and initialized in the following way:
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	#include "sling/nlp/parser/parser.h"	// Load parser model.sling::Store commons;sling::nlp::Parser parser;parser.Load &commons, "/tmp/sempar.flow" ;commons.Freeze  ;// Create document tokenizer.sling::nlp::DocumentTokenizer tokenizer;In order to parse some text, it first needs to be tokenized
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	#include "sling/nlp/parser/parser.h"	The document withtext, tokens, and frames is stored in a local document frame store.// Create frame store for document.sling::Store store &commons ;sling::nlp::Document document &store ;// Tokenize text.string text = "John hit the ball with a bat.";tokenizer.Tokenize &document, text ;// Parse document.parser.Parse &document ;document.Update  ;// Output document annotations.std::cout << sling::ToText document.top  , 2 ;
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Annotation Tools	SLING comes with utility tools for annotating a corpus of documents with framesusing a parser model, benchmarking this annotation process, and optionallyevaluating the annotated frames against supplied gold frames.We provide two such tools - tf-parse  sling/nlp/parser/tools/tf-parse.py  Python script, and a  Myelin-basedparser tool  sling/nlp/parser/tools/parse.cc .Given the same trained parser model, both these tools should producethe same annotated frames and evaluation numbers
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Annotation Tools	However the Myelin-basedparser is significantly faster than Tensorflow-based tf-parse   3x-10x in ourexperiments 
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Myelin-based parser tool	This tool takes the following commandline arguments:
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Tensorflow-based parser tool	An alternative to running the Myelin-based parsing tool is to run the tf-parsePython script that executes the annotation part of the Tensorflow graph over theinput documents
google-readmegoogle-sling.md	Tensorflow-based parser tool	It takes the following arguments:Sample Usage:

google-readmegoogle-slowfs.md	###Overriding Values	You can also override any option through the corresponding command line flag.For example, if you would like to change seek time:  slowfs --backing-dir=my-backing-dir --mount-dir=my-mount-dir \
google-readmegoogle-snappy-start.md	snappy-start: Tool for process startup snapshots	snappy-start is a tool which takes a snapshot of a Linux program's processstate after it has started up
google-readmegoogle-snappy-start.md	snappy-start: Tool for process startup snapshots	 It allows multiple instances of the programto be quickly launched from the snapshot.This has two potential benefits:
google-readmegoogle-snappy-start.md	Usage	First, build the tool by running make.sh  which also runs some tests .To create a snapshot:syscall, such as getpid  .Currently, the snapshot data is written to hard-coded files out_info containing register state and a list of memory mappings  and out_pages data to restore using mmap   .The idea for this tool comes from Kenton Varda, who proposed using a"record/replay" approach, using ptrace   to monitor syscalls so thatthey can later be replayed.
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Requirements	Souper should work on any reasonably modern Linux or OS X machine.You will need a reasonably modern compiler toolchain
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Requirements	LLVM has instructionson how to get one for Linux:You will also need CMake to build Souper and its dependencies.To run Souper over a bitcode file, you will need an SMT solver
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Requirements	Soupercan use Z3, Boolector, CVC4, or STP
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Requirements	We recommend ZIf you have Go installed, you will also need the Redigo Redis client:
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Building Souper	Download and build dependencies:Run CMake from a build directory:Run 'make' from the build directory.Optionally run 'make check' to run Souper's test suite
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Building Souper	To run the test suiteNote that GCC 4.8 and earlier have a bug in handling multiline stringliterals
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Building Souper	You should build Souper using GCC 4.9+ or Clang.
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	After following the above instructions, you will have a Souperexecutable in /path/to/souper-build/souper and a Clang executable in/path/to/souper/third_party/llvm/$buildtype/bin/clang
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	 You can use theClang executable to create an LLVM bitcode file like this:Once you have a bitcode file you can invoke Souper with the path to thebitcode file as a command line argument
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	You will also need one of theseflags to tell Souper where the SMT solver executable is:Souper will extract SMT queries from the bitcode file and pass them toa solver
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	Unsatisfiable queries  which represent missed optimizationopportunities  will cause Souper to print its internal representationof the optimizable expression along with the shorter expression thatrefines the original one.Alternatively, you may immediately let Souper modify the bitcode and letit apply the missed optimization opportunities by using the Souper llvm optpass
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	When loaded the pass will automatically register itself to run afterLLVM's regular peephole optimizations.For example:Or to run the pass on its own:Or use the drop-in compiler replacements sclang and sclang++:Compilation using Souper can be sped up by caching queries
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	By default, Souperuses a non-persistent RAM-based cache
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	The -souper-external-cache flag causesSouper to cache its queries in a Redis database
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	For this to work, Redis >=1.2.0 must be installed on the machine where you are running Souper and a Redisserver must be listening on the default port  6379 .sclang uses external caching by default since this often gives a substantialspeedup for large compilations
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	This behavior may be disabled by setting theSOUPER_NO_EXTERNAL_CACHE environment variable
google-readmegoogle-souper.md	Using Souper	Souper's Redis cache does not yethave any support for versioning; you should stop Redis and delete its dump fileany time Souper is upgraded.

google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	Disclaimer	Sprockets is a framework for conformance testing based on state transitions.To run conformance tests, Sprockets users should provide:test_driver.py is the main program made of Python to run conformance tests specified by users with a test manifest, STL files, and python libraries.
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	2.Environment Setup	To run test_driver.py, extra python packages below are necessary:
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	2.Options	usage: test_driver.py  -h   -a MANIFEST_ARGS   -d  manifestpositional arguments:  manifestoptional arguments:  -h, --help  -a MANIFEST_ARGS, --manifest-args MANIFEST_ARGS  -d, --debug
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	Test Manifest	The **test manifest*
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.Example manifest	example.test:  'stl_files':     ,   ,  },
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.stl_files	The ‘stl_files’ field must be a list of strings naming the STL files that include the transitions to be tested
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.stl_files	The filenames here should be relative to the manifest .test file
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.stl_files	In the example above,  example.test  example/example.test  and  example_base.stl  example/example_base.stl  are in the same directory.
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.roles	The ‘roles’ field must be list of dicts
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.roles	Each dict element in the list describes one role
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.roles	These are the roles described in the stl_files listed in the ‘stl_files’ field
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.roles	In the above example,  example_base.stl  example/example_base.stl  contains the following:example.stl:module example;role rReceiver {  string ipAddress;  string transportId;...This gets transformed intoThe ‘role’ key maps to the ‘module:rRoleName’, which in this case is ‘example::rReceiver’.The remaining key: value pairs map to the fields of the role as described in the STL file.
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.constants	The ‘constants’ field must be a dictionary
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.constants	Each entry in the dictionary defines a declared constant described in the stl_files listed in the ‘stl_files’ field
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.constants	In the above example,  example_base.stl  example/example_base.stl  contains the following:example_base.stl:module example;const string kHelloWorld;This value gets defined in the manifest here:
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.test	The ‘test’ field must be a list of strings naming the roles to be tested
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.test	Each entry in the test list must correspond to a ‘role’ value in the ‘roles’ list.
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.Substituting Parameters	Values can be substituted from the command line by passing a space separated list of = pairs to the --manifest-args option of test\_driver.py
google-readmegoogle-sprockets.md	3.Substituting Parameters	The manifest .test file will then replace any occurence of parameter_example.test:}This is exactly equivalent to running with the following manifest:parameter_example_with_substitues.test:}

google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	STM32 Bare Library	System functions and example code for programming the "Blue Pill" STM32-compatible micro-controller boards.This is not an officially supported Google product.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Introduction	You can now buy "Blue Pill" development boards individually for less than $These devices have ARM Cortex M3 CPUs running at 72MHz, 20KB of SRAM, and 64KB of flash, and consume far less energy than standard ARM processors
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Introduction	They offer an amazing amount of computing power for a cheap package that can be run on a battery for a long time
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Introduction	They are perfect for prototyping running compute-intensive algorithms like machine learning on embedded systems.Unfortunately, though their price point makes them very accessible, there are other barriers to getting started with the boards
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Introduction	They require separate hardware to program, and some basic wiring skills
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Introduction	The system software that you need to do anything useful with them is also often proprietary and confusing
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Introduction	This framework tackles all those problems by standardizing a work flow based on open software and hardware, providing step-by-step guides for the small amount of wiring needed, and offering self-contained system functions and examples in plain C.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	Before you get started, you'll need to have a few pieces of hardware available
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	No soldering or tools are required though, you should be able to assemble everything you need by hand
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	My thanks go to  Andy Selle  who pioneered the approach that I've documented below.These steps assume you have a Raspberry Pi 3 running a recent version of Raspbian
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	There's nothing that I know definitely won't work on a Pi 2  or a Pi Zero/One with an adjustment to the OpenOCD scripts , but I've not tested any other combinations
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	The approach I'm using came from  a great AdaFruit guide  which I recommend checking out for more background on what we're doing.The main piece of software we need to install is  OpenOCD  the Open On-Chip Debugger
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	Despite its name, this tool also handles flashing micro-controller flash memory with new programs, as well as displaying debug information from the chip
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	It does this through the Serial Wire Debug protocol, communicating through dedicated pins on the Blue Pill board.OpenOCD doesn't have a binary package for the Pi, but it is easy to compile
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	To build it, run these commands in the terminal on your Pi:The four pins at the thin end of the Blue Pill board are dedicate to the SWD protocol, and need to be connected to the right pins on the Pi's header, which OpenOCD will then control to program the chip
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	Here's a diagram showing how the wires should be attached between the Pi and the board:! Blue Pill Wiring This is based on the wiring recommended by the AdaFruit tutorial, where ground and power  3.3V  can be driven by any of the multiple pins on the Pi that supply them, SWDIO  the data pin  is on pin 24, and SWDCLK  the clock pin  is on pin I'm leaving the reset pin unconnected, since it's optional.! AdaFruit Diagram Here are some photos of my actual setup:! Blue Pill Wiring ! Pi Wiring ! Complete Picture of Wiring If you're using female-to-female jumper wires, you should be able to just push the connectors at each end onto the corresponding pins, and they should fit snugly with a small amount of force.There are also two yellow plastic jumper switches on the board
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	Normally they will both in position furthest away from the SWD pins, and closest to the small USB port
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	This is the recommended position for our workflow, but if they're in a different place when you get your board, you may need to move them back.Once you've wired in the ground and power  3.3v  connections, you should see a red LED on the board light up
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	What You Need	If it doesn't, check your wiring, or try another board in case there's a defect.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Building the Examples	Now you should be ready to build some example programs for the Blue Pill board
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Building the Examples	To do this, you'll need to clone  ARM's CMSIS 5 micro-controller library  from GitHub and get this repository too
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Building the Examples	You'll also need to install the cross-compilation toolchain for ARM.These are not quite like normal executables, they're just exact copies of the bytes that need to be copied into flash memory on the device
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Building the Examples	They don't contain any debug symbols, and the very start of flash has to be a table of function pointers, so making sure that boot.s is first in linking order is important
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Building the Examples	You don't need to worry about that for these examples, because the makefile takes care of all that, but once you start building your own programs you'll need to be careful.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Testing OpenOCD	Once you've got this library's repository from GitHub, you can start testing your wiring connection
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Testing OpenOCD	There are a lot of settings you need to pass to OpenOCD to make a successful link, so to make things easier these are included in  opened.cfg  in the root of the source tree
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Testing OpenOCD	To try out OpenOCD, run:
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Running Examples	With OpenOCD running in one terminal, open up a new window and type:Finally we need to restart the chip again, at which point it should try to execute the program we've just uploaded to flash
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Running Examples	We do this with the plain reset command, which with no arguments restarts the chip and begins execution.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debug Output	Blinking LEDs is fun, but to be at all productive on complex programs we need to be able to easily pass information back to the host computer for debugging purposes
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debug Output	The  Hello World example  shows how to use  DebugLog    to do this
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debug Output	To run it, execute these commands in the OpenOCD command console:The DebugLog   function can take several hundred milliseconds to execute, since it has to call back to the host machine, so it shouldn't be used in performance-critical code, but it is handy when you're trying to track down issues.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debugging with GDB	The standard Gnu debugger gdb works reasonably well with this setup
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debugging with GDB	To install it, run:For example, recompile and load the binary to the device againAnd interrupt it...Inspect variables...Inspect the stack...If you want to create your own programs using this framework, you should start off by copying one of the examples and expanding it
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debugging with GDB	You'll need to:Device manufacturers typically also release a header file that defines registers for peripherals that are not standard across all particular CPUs but that exist only on their boards
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debugging with GDB	Since Blue Pill SoCs are STM32-compatible, these would normally be in something like stm32f*.h, but this is only available as part of proprietary products from ST
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debugging with GDB	Instead, the  core_stm32.h  header includes a few of the most commonly-used device registers, as defined by  ST's reference guide to the processor  
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Debugging with GDB	These definitions are used to set up and control the LEDs for example.
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Further Reading	Looking through the  examples folder  should give you some ideas on the sort of things that are possible
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Further Reading	STM32duino  has a wealth of information on Blue Pill boards, and the name even comes from  a thread on their forums  Thomas Trebisky has some fantastic examples  of bare-metal STM32 programming, and I've found them very useful to reference as I've been working on this
google-readmegoogle-stm32_bare_lib.md	Further Reading	David Welch has also made available great sample code  for the STM Reference Manual  
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	Strabo is a system designed to make it easy to run fast, scalable, and potentially complex geospatial analyses over your data
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	It allows simple expressions likeMore complex queries are also possible, for instance:Strabo is a wrapper around  PostGIS  a widely used and well tested set of extensions to PostgreSQL that provide spatial indices, joins, querying, and shapefile operations
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	It is implemented in Elixir and runs on the BEAM VM, so the server is fault tolerant and queries automatically make use of all available cores if possible
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	Strabo currently comes with a Python-based query language, but client libraries for other languages are planned in the future
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	Strabo is still in the very early stages of development, and is definitely not recommended for production usage.Server InstallationInstall  Vagrant  and  VirtualBox  If you are running Ubuntu, make sure you install Vagrant directly from their website, as the version in the Ubuntu repos is out of date.Clone this repo
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	cd into it and run vagrant up
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	This step will take a while.Once the Vagrant box has been downloaded, installed and provisioned; type vagrant ssh  from within the Strabo directory .At the vagrant prompt, run run_migrations to install dependencies and run all schema migrations.Once migrations are complete, run start_server to start the Strabo server.You can run tests with run_tests.Now you can visit localhost:4001 from your browser
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	If it displays a "Welcome to Phoenix" page; you are good to go!Client InstallationThis repository includes a Python client library designed to interact with the Strabo server
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	To install it, cd into this repository and run-------Support for downloading geographic shapefiles from the US Census Bureau  and other data sources , importing into Strabo, and using them in queries like my_location.get_containing_polygon 'us_counties_2014'

google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	This is pretty much complete but needs to be cleaned up and documented.Allow saving a kernel  i.e
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	a Strabo query with parameters  to the database, and exposing said kernel as an API endpoint
google-readmegoogle-strabo.md	Strabo	This is nearly complete on the backend  there is a kernels table, and queries with parameters are supported , but it needs to be finished and documented.Legal notes

google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	SVCCA for Deep Learning Dynamics and Interpretability	This repository contains the core code for implementing Canonical Correlation Analysis on deep neural network representations, which was used for the results in the paper: Maithra Raghu   Justin Gilmer   Jason Yosinski   Jascha Sohl-Dickstein   2017 
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	SVCCA for Deep Learning Dynamics and Interpretability	"SVCCA: Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis for Deep Learning Dynamics and Interpretability"  Neural Information Processing Systems  NIPS  
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Dependencies	This code was written in Python 2.7 and relies on the numpy and pandas modules
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	The main function to compute CCA similarities between two representations is the get_cca_similarity function in  cca_core.py  cca_core.py 
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	This takes in two arrays of shape  num neurons1, num datapoints  ,  num neurons2, num_datapoints ,and outputs pairs of aligned directions, how well aligned they are, as well as coefficients to transform from the original neuron basis to the aligned directions.The  dft_ccas.py  dft_ccas.py  module builds on this functionality to work with convolutional networks
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	Convolutional layers have a more natural basis in terms of the number of channels, not raw neurons
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	Using some of the mathematical propertiesof the Discrete Fourier Transform, we have a computationally efficient method for comparing CCA similarity for convolutional layers
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	See Section 3 in the  paper  for more details
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	The fourier_ccas function in dft_ccas.py  dft_ccas.py  implements exactly this, taking the raw convolutional activations  num datapoints, height1, width1, num channels1 ,  num datapoints, height2, width2, num channels2 Note that according to the theory, we get an exact result if the datapoints used to _generate_  not train  the activations are translation invariant  any 2d translation of a datapoint x is also in the set of datapoints 
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Usage	But even without this, we can get very good results  see Examples section .
google-readmegoogle-svcca.md	Examples	In the paper, we apply this method to understand several aspects of neural network representations, and we give a couple of examples below.

google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Including the Loader	Download  es6-module-loader.js  and  traceur.js  from the  ES6-loader polyfill  and locate them in the same folder as system.js from this repo.Then include dist/system.js with a script tag in the page:
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Write and Load a Module	In the index.html page we can then load a module from the baseURL folder with:The module file at app/test.js will be loaded, its module format detected and any dependencies in turn loaded before returning the defined module.The entire loading class is implemented identically to the ES6 module specification, with the module format detection rules being the only addition.> _Note that when running locally, ensure you are running from a local server or a browser with local XHR requests enabled
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Write and Load a Module	If not you will get an error message._> _For Chrome on Mac, you can run it with: /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-file-access-from-files &> /dev/null &_> _In Firefox this requires navigating to about:config, entering security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy in the filter box and toggling the option to false._Working with Modules> Most of what is discussed in this section is simply the basics of using the new System loader
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Write and Load a Module	Only the extra module format support and plugin system is additional to this browser specification.Modules are dependency-managed JavaScript files
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Write and Load a Module	They are loaded by a **module name*Each module name directly corresponds to a JavaScript file URL, but without the .js extension, and with baseURL rules, mostly identical to RequireJS.The default baseURL rule is:  my/module -> resolve baseURL, 'my/module'  + '.js'
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Setting the baseURL	By default, the baseURL is set to the current page, but it can be changed with:The System loader comes with a paths configuration system
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Setting the baseURL	While not part of SystemJS, it is described here for completion._Note: The implementation is currently in discussion and not specified, thus it is subject to change._One can use the baseURL to reference library scripts like jquery, underscore etc.We then create a path for our local application scripts in their own separate folder, which can be set up with paths config:In this example, we can now write local application code in its own folder  app , without conflict with library code  js :
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Writing Modular Code	It is recommended to write modular code in either AMD or CommonJS
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Writing Modular Code	Both are equally supported by SystemJS, with the format detected automatically.For example, we can write modular CommonJS:javascript  exports.someMethod = function   {and load this with System.import 'app/module'  in the page.> Note: always use relative requires of the form ./ or ../ to reference modules in the same package
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Writing Modular Code	This is important within any package for modularity.
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Module Format Hints	The module format detection is well-tested over a large variety of libraries including complex UMD patterns
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Module Format Hints	It will detect in order ES6, AMD, then CommonJS and fall back to global modules.It is still impossible to write 100% accurate detection though.For this reason, it is also possible to write modules with the module format specified
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Module Format Hints	The module format is provided as a string, as the first line of code  excluding comments  in a file:It is recommended to use a format hint only in the few cases where the format detection would otherwise fail.
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Loading ES6 Modules	SystemJS is an ES6 module loader
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Loading ES6 Modules	It will detect and load ES6 modules, parsing them with Traceur dynamically
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Loading ES6 Modules	This allows for dynamic loading of ES6 without a build step, although a build step still needs to be run to transpile ES6 back to ES5 and AMD for production.A very simple example:For further examples of loading ES6 modules, see the  ES6 Module Loader polyfill documentation For examples of build workflows, see the  jspm CLI documentation 
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Automatic Global Detection	When no module format is detected, or when the "global" hint is present, modules are treated as global scripts.Any properties written to the global object  window, this, or the outer scope  will be detected and stored
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Automatic Global Detection	Then any dependencies of the global will have these properties rewritten before execution.In this way, global collissions are avoided
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Automatic Global Detection	Multiple versions of jQuery can run on the same page, for example.When only one new property is added to the global object, that is taken to be the global module.When many properties are written to the global object, the collection of those properties becomes the global module.This provides loading as expected in the majority of cases:The automatic detection handles most cases, but there are still scenarios where it is necessary to define the exported global name.To specify the exported name, provide an "export" string, directly beneath the "global" hint.javascript  "global";  "export MyGlobal.obj";  };Global modules can also specify dependencies using this same hint system.We write an "import" string, directly beneath the "global" hint.javascript  "global";  "import jquery";  "export $";  }
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	AMD Compatibility Layer	As part of providing AMD support, SystemJS provides a small AMD compatibility layer, with the goal of supporting as much of the RequireJS test suite as possible to ensure functioning of existing AMD code.To create the requirejs and require globals as AMD globals, simply include the following  tag immediately after the inclusion of the System loader:_Note that AMD-style plugins are not supported._Map configuration works just like other module loaders, altering the module name at the normalization stage
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	AMD Compatibility Layer	 System.map 'jquery'  = 'app/jquery@1.8.3';Map configuration also affects submodules:The order in which module format detection is performed, is provided by the System.formats
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	AMD Compatibility Layer	The default value is  'amd', 'cjs', 'global' .To add a new module format, specify it in the System.formats array, and then provide a System.format rule for it.The format rule provides two functions   System.formats =  'amd', 'cjs', 'myformat', 'global' ;  }For further examples, see the internal AMD or CommonJS support implemented in this way here.Plugins can be created to handle alternative loading scenarios, including loading assets such as CSS or images, and providing custom transpilation scenarios.Plugins are indicated by ! syntax, which unlike RequireJS is appended at the end of the module name, not the beginning.The plugin name is just a module name itself, and if not specified, is assumed to be the extension name of the module.Supported Plugins:Note that the AMD compatibility layer could provide a mapping from AMD plugins into SystemJS plugins that provide the same functionality as associated SystemJS plugins.
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Creating Plugins	A plugin is just a set of overrides for the loader hooks of the ES6 module specification.The hooks plugins can override are locate, fetch and translate.Read more on the loader hooks at the  ES6 Module Loader polyfill page 
google-readmegoogle-systemjs.md	Sample CoffeeScript Plugin	For example, we can write a CoffeeScript plugin with the following  CommonJS as an example, any module format works fine :javascript  var CoffeeScript = require 'coffeescript' ;  }By overriding the translate hook, we now support CoffeeScript loading with:A CSS plugin, on the other hand, would override the fetch hook:javascript  exports.fetch = function load  {  }Each loader hook can either return directly or return a thenable for the value.The other loader hooks are also treated identically to the specification.---

google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Tangent 	   ! Join the chat at   Tangent is a new, free, and open-source Python library for automatic differentiation.! Autodiff Tool Space  docs/toolspace.png "Autodiff Tool Space" As a result, you can finally read your automatic derivative code just like the rest of your program
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Tangent 	Tangent is useful to researchers and students who not only want to write their models in Python, but also read and debug automatically-generated derivative code without sacrificing speed and flexibility.Tangent works on a large and growing subset of Python, provides extra autodiff features other Python ML libraries don't have, has reasonable performance, and is compatible with TensorFlow and NumPy.This project is an experimental release, and is under active development
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Tangent 	As we continue to build Tangent, and respond to feedback from the community, there might be API changes.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Usage	Note: An interactive notebook with all the code in this page can be found  here Tangent has a one-function API:If you want to print out derivatives at the time Tangent generates the derivative function:! Live Derivatives with Tangent  docs/sct-ad-live.gif "Live Derivatives with Tangent" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Installation	The easiest way to install Tangent is to use pip.We'll have a conda package soon.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Automatic Differentiation	Under the hood, tangent.grad grabs the source code of the Python function you pass it  using inspect.getsource, which is available in the Python standard library , converts the source code into an abstract syntax tree  AST  using ast.parse  also built into the Python standard library , and walks the syntax tree in reverse order.Tangent has a library of recipes for the derivatives of basic arithmetic  +,-,/,**,* , pieces of syntax  ast.For, ast.If, ast.While  and TensorFlow Eager functions  tf.reduce_sum, tf.exp, tf.matmul, ..
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Automatic Differentiation	 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Automatic Differentiation	For each piece of syntax it encounters  for example, c = a + b is a single AST node ast.Assign , tangent.grad looks up the matching backward-pass recipe, and adds it to the end of the derivative function.This reverse-order processing gives the technique its name: reverse-mode automatic differentiation.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	TF Eager	Tangent supports differentiating functions that use TensorFlow Eager functions that are composed together.def f W,x :  h1 = tf.matmul x,W   h2 = tf.tanh h1   out = tf.reduce_sum h2   return outdfdW = tangent.grad f ! SCT on TF Eager  docs/sct-ad-tf.gif "SCT on TF Eager" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Subroutines	When model code becomes long, using subroutines makes code more readable and reusable
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Subroutines	Tangent handles taking derivatives of models that have user-defined functions.! SCT on Subroutines  docs/sct-ad-subroutine.gif "SCT on Subroutines" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	Tangent has recipes for auto-generating derivatives for code that contains if statements and loops:! SCT on Conditionals  docs/sct-ad-conditional.gif "SCT on Conditionals" You'll notice above that we have to modify the user's code to keep track of information that we will need in the backward pass
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	For instance, we need to save which branch of an if-statement was followed in the forward pass, so that we run the correct branch in the backward pass
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	We save this information from the forward pass by pushing it onto a stack, which we then pop off in the backward pass
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	This is an important data structure in ahead-of-time autodiff.For loops require a little more bookkeeping
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	Tangent has to save the number of iterations of the loop on the stack
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	Also, loops usually overwrite the values of variables inside the loop body
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Control Flow	In order to generate a correct derivative, Tangent has to keep track of all of the overwritten values, and restore them in the backward pass in the correct order.! SCT on Loops  docs/sct-ad-loop.gif "SCT on Loops" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	Tangent uses Python's built-in machinery to introspect and transform the _abstract syntax tree_  AST  of parsed source code at runtime
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	For each piece of supported Python syntax, we have implemented a rule indicating how to rewrite an AST node into its backward pass equivalent, or "adjoint"
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	We have defined adjoints for function calls to NumPy and TF Eager methods, as well as larger pieces of syntax, such as if-statements and for-loops
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	The adjoints are stored in function definitions that serve as "templates", or code macros
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	Another alternative, which we found too cumbersome, would be to use a templating engine like  Mustache  and store adjoints as plain strings
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	Our templates also use a special syntax d x  to refer to the derivative of a variable x.While differentiating a function, if Tangent encounters a function call, it first checks if it has a gradient registered for that function
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	If not, it tries to get the function source, and generate a derivative ahead-of-time
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	But, it's easy to register your own gradients
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Custom Gradients	Here's a toy example of defining the gradient of x^3.import tangentfrom tangent.grads import adjointdef cube x :  return x
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	is used in your containing function.	@adjoint cube def dcube result, x :  d x  = d result print tangent.grad f,verbose=1  The signature for the custom gradient of some functionThe first argument to the template is always the result of the function call, followed by the function arguments, in order.Tangent captures the variable names of the result and arguments, and then will use them to unquote the gradient template at the appropriate place in the backward pass.Check out an  example gradient definition of a NumPy function  and  of a TF eager function  Also,  see the docstring in grads.py for more info 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	Because Tangent auto-generates derivative code you can read, you can also easily debug your backward pass
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	For instance, your NN might be outputting NaNs during training, and you want to find out where the NaNs are being generated in your model
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	Just insert a breakpoint  e.g., pdb.set_trace    at the end of your forward pass.! SCT for Debugging  docs/sct-ad-debugging.png "SCT for Debugging" For large models, setting a breakpoint at the beginning of the backward pass and stepping through dozens of lines might be cumbersome
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	Instead, you might want the breakpoint to be placed later in the derivative calculation
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	Tangent lets you insert code directly into any location in the backward pass
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	First, run from tangent import insert_grad_of, then add a with insert_grad_of block containing the code you'd like to insert into the backward pass.from tangent import insert_grad_ofdef f x :  ..
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Debugging	 with insert_grad_of x  as dx:  ...! Ad Hoc Gradient Code  docs/sct-ad-insert_grad_of.gif "Ad Hoc Gradient Code" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	You can use the insert_grad_of feature to do more than debugging and logging
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	Some NN architectures benefit from tricks that directly manipulate the backward pass
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	For example, recurrent neural networks  RNNs  suffer from the "exploding gradient" problem, where gradients grow exponentially
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	This prevents the model from training properly
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	A typical solution is to force the derivatives inside of an RNN to not exceed a certain value by directly clipping them
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	We can implement this with insert_grad_of.def f params, x :  h = x  for i in range 5 :  return hdfdparams = tangent.grad f You can perform other backward-pass tricks with insert_grad_of, such as stop gradients  use a break in the inlined code to stop a for loop , or synthetic gradients  replace a derivative with a prediction from a neural network 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Derivative Surgery	This feature lets Tangent users easily debug their models, or quickly try out derivative tweaks in the backward pass.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Forward Mode	Reverse-mode autodiff, or backpropagation, generates efficient derivatives for the types of functions we use in machine learning, where there are usually many  perhaps millions  of input variables and only a single output  our loss 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Forward Mode	When the inverse is true, where there are many more outputs than inputs, reverse mode is not an efficient algorithm, as it has to be run as many times as there are output variables
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Forward Mode	However, a less famous algorithm, forward-mode autodiff, only has to be run as many times as there are _input_ variables
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Forward Mode	Tangent supports forward-mode autodiff.def f x :  a = x  c = a + b  return cforward_df = tangent.autodiff f, mode='forward' ! SCT Forward Mode  docs/sct-ad-forward.gif "SCT Forward Mode" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Hessian-Vector Products	Although we won't dig into the technical details, forward-mode is very useful when combined with reverse-mode to calculate efficient higher-order derivatives, particularly for Hessian-vector products  HVP  of NNs
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Hessian-Vector Products	This is useful in research applications, and usually very painful and slow to calculate
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Hessian-Vector Products	Autograd has native forward-mode support, while TensorFlow has 3rd-party support.To take higher-order derivatives, you can use any combination of forwarddef f x :hvp = tangent.autodiff tangent.autodiff f,mode='reverse' ,mode='forward' 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Performance	Although we did not build Tangent for performance, it is competitive with major ML libraries
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Performance	Because we are generating derivatives ahead-of-time, there is no interpretive overhead like there is with runtime autodiff libraries
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Performance	We implemented a few compiler optimizations  dead code elimination, and constant folding , but we are still working on extra optimization passes to further increase performance.! Small Benchmark  docs/small-benchmark.png "Small Benchmark" 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Optimization	We are often interested in the gradients of only some of the arguments
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Optimization	In thiscase, many of the adjoint calculation might be dead code
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Optimization	In the optimizationpass this is removed
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Optimization	We also perform limited constant folding and assignment propagation.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Known Limitations	Tangent is still an experiment, so expect some bugs
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Known Limitations	If you report them to us on GitHub, we will do our best to fix them quickly.We are working to add support in Tangent for more aspects of the Python language  e.g., closures, inline function definitions, classes, more NumPy and TensorFlow functions 
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Known Limitations	We also hope to add more advanced automatic differentiation and compiler functionality in the future, such as automatic trade-off between memory and compute  Griewank and Walther 2000; Gruslys et al., 2016 , more aggressive optimizations, and lambda lifting.Many of Python's advanced features are difficult to statically analyze or todefine sensible gradients of, so we restrict Python to a functional subset i.e
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Known Limitations	no mutable objects .
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Closures	Closures are currently not supported for the following reasons:  will resolve to the same function at each call.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Classes	Classes are not _currently_ supported, but are on our near-term roadmap.This will enable PyTorch/Chainer/TFEager-style class definitions of neural networks, and parameterized functions, like in TF Slim.
google-readmegoogle-tangent.md	Team	Tangent is developed by Alex Wiltschko, Bart van Merrienboer and Dan Moldovan.
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	tarpc: Tim & Adam's RPC lib	     ! Software License   LICENSE  ! Latest Version   ! Join the chat at   *Disclaimer*: This is not an official Google product.tarpc is an RPC framework for rust with a focus on ease of use
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	tarpc: Tim & Adam's RPC lib	Defining aservice can be done in just a few lines of code, and most of the boilerplate ofwriting a server is taken care of for you
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	tarpc: Tim & Adam's RPC lib	Documentation 
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	What is an RPC framework?	"RPC" stands for "Remote Procedure Call," a function call where the work ofproducing the return value is being done somewhere else
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	What is an RPC framework?	When an rpc function isinvoked, behind the scenes the function contacts some other process somewhereand asks them to evaluate the function instead
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	What is an RPC framework?	The original function thenreturns the value produced by the other process.RPC frameworks are a fundamental building block of most microservices-orientedarchitectures
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	What is an RPC framework?	Two well-known ones are  gRPC  and Cap'n Proto tarpc differentiates itself from other RPC frameworks by defining the schema in code,rather than in a separate language such as .proto
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	What is an RPC framework?	This means there's no separate compilationprocess, and no cognitive context switching between different languages
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	What is an RPC framework?	Additionally, itworks with the community-backed library serde: any serde-serializable type can be used asarguments to tarpc fns.
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Usage	**NB**: *this example is for master
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Usage	Are you looking for other versions Add to your Cargo.toml dependencies:tarpc has two APIs: sync for blocking code and future for asynchronouscode
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Usage	Here's how to use the sync api.
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	#! plugin tarpc_plugins  	extern crate futures;
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	macro_use 	extern crate tarpc;extern crate tokio_core;use futures::Future;use tarpc::future::{client, server};use tarpc::future::client::ClientExt;use tarpc::tls;use tarpc::util::{FirstSocketAddr, Never};use tokio_core::reactor;use tarpc::native_tls::{Pkcs12, TlsAcceptor};service! {
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	derive Clone  	struct HelloServer;impl FutureService for HelloServer {fn get_acceptor   -> TlsAcceptor {fn main   {
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures	Here's the same service, implemented using futures.
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	By default, tarpc internally uses a  TcpStream  for communication between your clients andservers
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	However, TCP by itself has no encryption
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	As a result, your communication will be sent inthe clear
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	If you want your RPC communications to be encrypted, you can choose to use  TLS 
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	TLSoperates as an encryption layer on top of TCP
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	When using TLS, your communication will occur over a TlsStream 
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	You can add the ability to make TLS clients and servers by adding tarpcwith the tls feature flag enabled.When using TLS, some additional information is required
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	You will need to make  client::tls::Context structs; client::tls::Context requires a  TlsConnector 
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	The TlsAcceptor  and  TlsConnector  types are defined in the  native-tls 
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	tarpc re-exportsexternal TLS-related types in its native_tls module  tarpc::native_tls 
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Example: Futures + TLS	TLS :  TcpStream :  TlsStream :  TlsAcceptor :  TlsConnector :  native-tls : Both TLS streams and TCP streams are supported in the same binary when the tls feature is enabled.However, if you are working with both stream types, ensure that you use the TLS clients with TLSservers and TCP clients with TCP servers.
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Sync vs Futures	A single service! invocation generates code for both synchronous and future-based applications.It's up to the user whether they want to implement the sync API or the futures API
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Sync vs Futures	The sync API hasthe simplest programming model, at the cost of some overhead thread
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Sync vs Futures	The futures API is based on tokio and can run on any tokio-compatible executor
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Sync vs Futures	This mean aservice that implements the futures API for a tarpc service can run on a single thread, avoidingcontext switches and the memory overhead of having a thread per RPC.
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Errors	All generated tarpc RPC methods return either std::error::Error  if no error type is explicitly specified in the service! macro invocation
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Errors	Anerror type can be specified like so:use tarpc::util::Message;service! {tarpc::util::Message is just a wrapper around string that implements std::error::Error providedfor service implementations that don't require complex error handling
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Errors	The pipe is used as syntaxfor specifying the error type in a way that's agnostic of whether the service implementation issynchronous or future-based
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Errors	Note that in the simpler examples in the readme, no pipe is used, andthe macro automatically chooses tarpc::util::Never as the error type.The above declaration would produce the following synchronous service trait:trait FutureService {
google-readmegoogle-tarpc.md	Documentation	Use cargo doc as you normally would to see the documentation created for allitems expanded by a service! invocation.

google-readmegoogle-templatekit.md	#TemplateKit	Its goal is tobecome a default tool for implementing complex custom views withabstractions optimized for the most common cases.TemplateKit provides an intuitive and efficient DSL to perform commontasks in view programming such as view hierarchy construction, datapopulation, and layout
google-readmegoogle-templatekit.md	#TemplateKit	View code written with TemplateKit is muchshorter and more readable than code written with the raw UIView API.For example, to implement a classic table view cell with an image onthe left and two stacked texts on the right like this:you would just write:These seven lines of template code in the block is enough to tell the framework toconstruct a view hierarchy with one UIImageView instance and two UILabel instances,populate them with runtime data, and lay out the view hierarchy with the specifiedmargin and paddings
google-readmegoogle-templatekit.md	#TemplateKit	Even a very simple view like this would take several dozens oflines if it were implemented with the raw UIView API.Find examples in SampleApp/Templates.

google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	tern-closure	 tern-closure  tern-closure  is a plugin which adds support for  ClosureCompiler annotations  compiler  and the Closure type system to the JavaSriptcode intelligence system  Tern  tern .To use tern-closure, you need to  install  #installation  it and then configure  #configuration  Tern to load it.
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	Features	tern-closure adds the following features to your Tern installation:Understanding of types in JSDoc type annotations  similar to theUnderstanding of inheritance and interfaces with @extends andCompletion and go-to-definition support for type names in JSDoc comments andAutomatic loading of the definitions for types, so that you get completion
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 Installation	Currently, tern-closure only works with the NodeJS  Tern Server  tern-server ,and not within a browser.
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	Short version	After installing Tern according the setup instructions of your desired  editorplugin  tern-editor , go to the place where the  Tern package  tern-npm  wasinstalled  or the  Tern repo  tern-repo  was cloned  and runSee  INSTALL.md  INSTALL.md  for instructions tailored to each editor.
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 Configuration	In order for Tern to load the tern-closure plugin once it is installed, you mustinclude .tern-project in your project's root directory, or .tern-config in your homeYou must also explicitly disable the default doc_comment plugin, which willinterfere with tern-closure.Here is a minimal example .tern-project configuration file:
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	"Project directory" and .tern-project vs .tern-config	Tern looks for .tern-config is loaded instead, and *the working directory of the Tern serverprocess is used as the "project directory"*.Since Tern and tern-closure  including finders like  grep  #grep   use the"project directory" as the base for all relative paths, you should either use.tern-project or be careful about where you start your Tern server  or, whereyour editor plugin starts your Tern server .
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	Options	You can set the following options in the closure section of your Ternconfiguration file:
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 Finders 	tern-closure uses "finders" to find the files providing Closure names viagoog.provide
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 Finders 	Finders allow tern-closure to load and interpret the filesproviding names required via goog.require or referenced in JSDoc type stringsso it better understands the context of a given file.The finder section of the options object for closure in your .tern-projectfile specifies what finder implementation you want to use, and what options youwant to pass to the finder
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 Finders 	By default, no finder is used, and files are notautomatically loaded
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 Finders 	Currently, only one finder implementation is included withtern-closure,  grep  #grep .*Common finder options:*
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 grep	This is a basic finder which uses the grep command-line utility  or findstrin Windows  to search for goog.provide statements at startup and create a mapof Closure names to providing files.Here is an example .tern-project file using the grep finder:You can easily use a finder not included in this repository, or implement yourown
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	 grep	This allows you to search for names in different ways, on demand, and touse existing indexes of your codebase.Given a finder name name, tern-closure first looks in its own lib/finderdirectory, then attempts to load name using require  , so a third-partyfinder module can be installed as an npm package.A finder module must implement a simple interface:Please note that while tern-closure is in a 0.X.X release, the finder API maybe subject to breaking changes.
google-readmegoogle-tern-closure.md	Bug reports and feature requests	Please file bug reports and feature requests as issues on the  issuespage  tern-closure-issues  of the tern-closure repository.

google-readmegoogle-testimony.md	Wire Protocol ###	 At any time post-connection, either the server or client maysend arbitrary TLV values across the wire..
google-readmegoogle-testimony.md	Wire Protocol ###	the other side should handlethem if it knows how and ignore them if it doesn't.The server sends a block index to the client when that block isavailable to process  and it references the block internally 
google-readmegoogle-testimony.md	Wire Protocol ###	 The clientreturns the block index to the server when it's done processing it, and theserver unrefs that block
google-readmegoogle-testimony.md	Wire Protocol ###	 When a block has no more references, it is returnedto the kernel to be refilled with packets.

google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Acknowledge	Tiger is highly inspired by Dagger, Kudos to those great guys.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Challenge	If you find a faster DI framework, let me know
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Challenge	I will drop the title as long as it is proved.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	It is the fastest! Not faster, but the fastest! I have tried it on a big project with ~200 modules
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	While it takes hundreds of milliseconds to instantiate dagger components, on the same hardware, it only takes a few milliseconds to instantiate Tiger injectors.Minimal amount of code to write therefore easy to maintain, if you need to maintain it at all
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	You don't need to write components like in Dagger
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	You don't need to split a module into several modules one for each scope that used by bindings provided by the module
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	You will feel it is some easy to change the scope of a binding
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	Just change it
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Why Tiger?	Way to go, isn’t it?
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Build up your knowledge	If you are here, you must already be familiar with DI Dependency Injection  and its advantage
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Build up your knowledge	Otherwise  wiki  will be your friend.DI has been evolving for long time in the different form
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Build up your knowledge	But the concept is not really changed much
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Build up your knowledge	This document will not repeat these concepts
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Build up your knowledge	If you find some concept not explained, google it
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Build up your knowledge	Also Guice probably has explained those concept very well.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Integration	Tiger is an annotation process
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Integration	Therefore just build the jar and use it the way that annotation processors are supposed to be used
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Integration	All environment should work
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Integration	The sample uses gradle.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	Before diving into details, it will be helpful, very helpful, to understand the intended usage of tiger
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	Tiger is designed to let the machine do as much as possible and let human do as little as possible
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	It requires minimal information from the developer
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	From these information, scoped injectors are generated
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	Application can instances these injectors and use them to inject classes
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	To achieve this, tiger has distilled the information needed to generate injectors
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	How?	Here are they, with related annotation.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Scopes	Usually application has at least one scope, singleton
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Scopes	Even if there is no scoped binding, it is harmless to have a singleton scope
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Scopes	Therefore, tiger requires there always be a scope tree
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Scopes	The root is usually singleton, but not necessary
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Scopes	Details will be shown later in the sample
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Scopes	Tiger generates one injector class for each scope.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@tiger.ScopeDependency	It specifies the dependencies between scopes
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@tiger.ScopeDependency	All the dependency information form a scope tree.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@dagger.Module	It provides binding information through @Provides annotated methods with optional scope
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@dagger.Module	Now 2016/08/10   we just reuse dagger.Module
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@dagger.Module	In future, dagger.Module will be copied into tiger.Module so that tiger does not need to depend on dagger.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@javax.inject.Inject on ctor	It provides binding information with optional scope.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@tiger.MembersInjector with mandatory scope	It specifies interfaces which includes class that has fields or methods to be injected
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@tiger.MembersInjector with mandatory scope	Injectors will implement all these interfaces.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@javax.inject.Inject on fields, methods	It specifies the injection points from which injector fans out when injecting an object.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@tiger.PackageForGenerated	The package for the generated injectors.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@tiger.ScopedComponentNames	It specify the names of the injectors.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	@Module, @Inject and @MembersInjector are naturally scattered around the code. For the others, i.e., @ScopeDependency, @PackageForGenerated, @ScopedComponentNames and @GenerationTriggerAnnotation, we suggest to put them into a dedicated java file as the central configuration information for the app.	Here is the depicted code the sample with some modification  java@PackageForGenerated "sample" public class Scopes {Here is how ApplicationInjector is instantiated and used.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	As you can see, Tiger reuses annotations from dagger like dagger.Module, dagger.Provides, etc
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	You can find the javadoc  here  We are not going to repeat them here
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	Of course, Component and Subcomponent is not needed any longer
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	Producer related stuff is also irrelevant to injection
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	There is one nice feature from Tiger
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	You don't need to split modules according to different scopes
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	Yes, you can put bindings of different scopes into one module
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	This way you have less modules
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	For Dagger users	And, if you want to change the scope of a binding, just change it, easy.
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Tip	Inspecting the generate code will help you
google-readmegoogle-tiger.md	Tip	If you want more, there is source code.Enjoy injection!

google-readmegoogle-tink.md	Getting started	 Bazel  then build, runand play with the  hello worldexamples Tink performs cryptographic tasks via so-called  primitives  docs/PRIMITIVES.md ,each of which is defined via a corresponding interface that specifies thefunctionality of the primitive
google-readmegoogle-tink.md	Getting started	For example, _symmetric key encryption_ isoffered via an  _AEAD-primitive_  Authenticated Encryption with AssociatedData   docs/PRIMITIVES.md#authenticated-encryption-with-associated-data , thatsupports two operations:Before implementations of primitives can be used, they must be registered atruntime with Tink, so that Tink "knows" the desired implementations
google-readmegoogle-tink.md	Getting started	Here's howyou can register all implementations of all primitives in Tink:After implementations of primitives have been registered, the basic use of Tinkproceeds in three steps: Load or generate the cryptographic key material  a Keyset in Tink terms 
google-readmegoogle-tink.md	Getting started	Use the key material to get an instance of the chosen primitive
google-readmegoogle-tink.md	Getting started	Use that primitive to accomplish the cryptographic task.Here is how these steps would look like when encrypting or decrypting with anAEAD primitive in Java:

google-readmegoogle-tmppy.md	Example	As an example, let's write a metafunction  aka type trait class  add_pointer_multiple such that:However this syntax is quite verbose and not very readable
google-readmegoogle-tmppy.md	Example	For more complex metafunctions this becomes a significant issue, leading to more bugs and more effort when debugging or maintaining the code.Some C++ metaprogramming libraries  notably Boost's MPL library  can be used to reduce the verbosity, however that comes at the price of slower compile times.Using TMPPy, the above can be written as:And this TMPPy code can then be compiled to C++ code equivalent to the metafunction above  without the overhead of e.g

google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Or just run the linters alone:	gometalinter --config=gometalinter.json ./...------
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Design Overview	Trillian is primarily implemented as a gRPC service this service receives get/set requests over gRPC and retrieves the correspondingMerkle tree data from a separate storage layer  currently using MySQL , ensuringthat the cryptographic properties of the tree are preserved along the way.The Trillian service is multi-tenanted &ndash; a single Trillian installationcan support multiple Merkle trees in parallel, distinguished by their TreeId&ndash; and operates in one of two modes:proofs of inclusion/consistency are available for data items added to the
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Personalities	The Trillian service expects to be paired with additional code that is specificto the particular application of the transparent store; this is known as aThe primary purpose of a personality is to implement **admission criteria*the store, so that only particular types of data are added to the store
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Personalities	Forexample, a certificate transparency log only accepts data items that are validcertificates; a "CT Log" personality would police this, so that the Trillianservice can process all incoming data blindly.A personality may also perform **canonicalization*convert equivalent formulations of the same underlying data to a singlecanonical format, avoiding needless duplication
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Personalities	  For example, keys inJSON dictionaries could be sorted, or Unicode string data could be normalised
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Personalities	The per-application personality is also responsible for providing anexternally-visible interface, typically over HTTP S .Note that a personality may need to implement its own data store,separate from Trillian
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Personalities	 In particular, if the personality does notcompletely trust Trillian, it needs to store the various things thatTrillian signs in order to be able to detect problems  and so thepersonality effectively also acts as a monitor for Trillian .
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Map Mode	Trillian in Map mode can be thought of as providing a key:value store, togetherwith cryptographic transparency guarantees for that data.When running in Map mode, Trillian provides a straightforward gRPC API with thefollowing available operations: Documentation may be out-of-date; please check the protocol buffer message definitions  trillian_map_api.proto  for the definitive current map API
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Map Mode	Each SetLeaves request includes a batch of updates to the Map; once all ofthese updates have been applied, the Map has a new **revision**, with a new treehead for that revision
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Map Mode	 To allow historical queries, the API allows queriesof the Map as of a particular revision.TODO: add description of per-personality MappersTODO: add description of distribution: how many instances run, how distributed,how synchronized  master election , mention use of transactions as a fallback in case of errors in master election .! Map components  docs/MapDesign.png 
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Log Mode	When running in Log mode, Trillian provides a gRPC API whose operations aresimilar to those available for Certificate Transparency logs cf
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Log Mode	 RFC 6962  These include:In Log mode, Trillian includes an additional Signer component; this componentperiodically processes pending queued items and adds them to the Merkle tree,creating a new signed tree head as a result.! Log components  docs/LogDesign.png TODO: add description of distribution: how many instances run, how distributed etc.
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Logged Map	As it currently stands, it is not possible to reliably monitor or audit aTrillian Map instance; key:value pairs can be modified and subsequently resetwithout anyone noticing.A future plan to deal with this is to create a *Logged Map*, which combines aTrillian Map with a Trillian Log so that all published revisions of the Maphave their signed tree head data appended to the corresponding Map.Use Cases
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Certificate Transparency Log	The most obvious application for Trillian in Log mode is to provide acertificate transparency  RFC 6962  Log
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Certificate Transparency Log	 To do this, the CT Log personalityneeds to include all of the certificate-specific processing &ndash; inparticular, checking that an item that has been suggested for inclusion isindeed a valid certificate that chains to an accepted root.
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Verifiable Log-Derived Map	One useful application for Trillian in Map mode is to provide a verifiablelog-derived map  VLDM , as described in the Verifiable Data Structures  docs/VerifiableDataStructures.pdf  white paper which uses the term 'log-backed map' 
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Verifiable Log-Derived Map	 To do this, a VLDM personality wouldmonitor the additions of entries to a Log, potentially external, and would writesome kind of corresponding key:value data to a Trillian Map.Clients of the VLDM are then able to verify that the entries in the Map they areshown are also seen by anyone auditing the Log for correct operation, which inturn allows the client to trust the key/value pairs returned by the Map.A concrete example of this might be a VLDM that monitors a certificatetransparency Log and builds a corresponding Map from domain names to the set ofcertificates associated with that domain.The following table summarizes properties of data structures laid in the Verifiable Data Structures  docs/VerifiableDataStructures.pdf  white paper.“Efficiently” means that a client can and should perform this validationthemselves
google-readmegoogle-trillian.md	Verifiable Log-Derived Map	 “Full audit” means that to validate correctly, a client would needto download the entire dataset, and is something that in practice we expect asmall number of dedicated auditors to perform, rather than being done by each| ---------------------------------------| Prove inclusion of value| Prove non-inclusion of value| Retrieve provable value for key| Retrieve provable current value for key  |  Impractical| Prove append-only| Enumerate all entries| Prove correct operation| Enable detection of split-view

google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Time Series Bridge  ts-bridge 	Time Series Bridge is a tool that can be used to import metrics from onemonitoring system to another
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Time Series Bridge  ts-bridge 	It regularly runs a specific query againsta source monitoring system  currently only Datadog  and writes result into thedestination system  currently only Stackdriver .ts-bridge is an App Engine Standard app written in Go.
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Quick Start	  Add it into $PATH
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Quick Start	 cd app/ && goapp deploy -application $APP_ID -version live
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	To import a metric from Datadog, ts-bridge regularly runs a configured queryagainst the  Datadog QueryAPI Metrics imported from Datadog are defined in the datadog_metrics section ofthe configuration file  app/metrics.yaml 
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	The following parameters need tobe specified for each metric:  stackdriver_destinations section of the configuration file.All parameters are required.Please keep in mind the following details about Datadog API:  the whole organization
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	Even if ts-bridge is the only user of the Query API,  it still means you can only import 5 metrics if you are querying every minute   which is the default 
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	The limit can be raised
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	 as part of your query, Datadog will return a single point per each rollup  interval
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	If rollup interval is longer than the importing period of  ts-bridge, some import operations will fetch 0 new points
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	For example, if  your query is producing a 10-minute ratio    xxx.rollup sum, 600  / yyy.rollup sum, 600   and you are using the default  importing period  1 minute , ts-bridge will still issue the query every  minute, however Datadog will only return a single point once every 10 minutes
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	 interval 
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Datadog	Please keep in mind that Datadog might return more than 1 point  per minute, and all points will be written to Stackdriver, even though  Stackdriver does not allow querying with  alignment period  
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Stackdriver	Imported metrics can be written to multiple destination Stackdriver projects,even though in practice we expect a single instance of Time Series Bridge towrite to a single project  usually matching the GCP project where thets-bridge is running .Stackdriver destinations are listed in the stackdriver_destinationssection of the configuration file
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Stackdriver	The following parameters can be specifiedfor each destination:  ts-bridge is running will be used.If you are using ts-bridge to write metrics to a different Stackdriver projectthan the one it's running in, you will need to grant roles/monitoring.editorIAM permission to the service account used by the ts-bridge App Engine app toallow it to read and write Stackdriver metrics.
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Importing period	Time Series Bridge attempts to import all configured metrics regularly
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Importing period	Thisis driven by the  App Engine Cron Service   which isconfigured in app/cron.yaml
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Importing period	By default metrics are imported every minute.
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Global settings	Some other settings can be set globally as App Engine environment variables viathe env_variables section of app/app.yaml
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Global settings	 points are found
google-readmegoogle-ts-bridge.md	Global settings	This interval should be kept reasonably short to  avoid fetching too much data from Stackdriver on each update

google-readmegoogle-turbine.md	Turbine	Turbine is a header compiler for Java.
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Summary	Turbinia is an open-source framework for deploying, managing, and running distributed forensic workloads
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Summary	 It is intended to automate running of common forensic processing tools  i.e
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Summary	Plaso, TSK, strings, etc  to help with processing evidence in the Cloud, scaling the processing of large amounts of evidence, and decreasing response time by parallelizing processing where possible.
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	Turbinia is composed of different components for the client, server and the workers
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 These components can be run in the Cloud, on local machines, or as a hybrid of both
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 The Turbinia client makes requests to process evidence to the Turbinia server
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 The Turbinia server creates logical jobs from these incoming user requests, which creates and schedules forensic processing tasks to be run by the workers
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 The evidence to be processed will be split up by the jobs when possible, and many tasks can be created in order to process the evidence in parallel
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 One or more workers run continuously to process tasks from the server
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 Any new evidence created or discovered by the tasks will be fed back into Turbinia for further processing.Communication from the client to the server is currently done with either Google Cloud PubSub or  Kombu  messaging
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	How it works	 The worker implementation can use either  PSQ   a Google Cloud PubSub Task Queue  or  Celery  for task scheduling.More information on Turbinia and how it works can be  found here  docs/how-it-works.md .
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Status	Turbinia is currently in Alpha release.
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Installation	There is an  rough installation guide here  docs/install.md .
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Usage	The basic steps to get things running after the initial installation and configuration are: usage: turbiniactl  -h   -q   -v   -d   -a   -f   -o OUTPUT_DIR   -L LOG_FILE optional arguments:  -h, --help  -q, --quiet  -v, --verbose  -d, --debug  -a, --all_fields  -f, --force_evidence  Force evidence processing request in potentially  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR  -L LOG_FILE, --log_file LOG_FILE  -r REQUEST_ID, --request_id REQUEST_ID  -S, --server  -C, --use_celery  -V, --version  -D, --dump_json  -F FILTER_PATTERNS_FILE, --filter_patterns_file FILTER_PATTERNS_FILE  -j JOBS_WHITELIST, --jobs_whitelist JOBS_WHITELIST  -J JOBS_BLACKLIST, --jobs_blacklist JOBS_BLACKLIST  -p POLL_INTERVAL, --poll_interval POLL_INTERVAL  -w, --wait  The commands for processing the evidence types of rawdisk and directory specify information about evidence that Turbinia should process
google-readmegoogle-turbinia.md	Usage	By default, when adding new evidence to be processed, turbiniactl will act as a client and send a request to the configured Turbinia server, otherwise if usage: turbiniactl rawdisk  -h  -l LOCAL_PATH  -s SOURCE   -n NAME optional arguments:  -h, --help  -l LOCAL_PATH, --local_path LOCAL_PATH  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE  -n NAME, --name NAME  Descriptive name of the evidence

google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	UniFlow for Polymer 2.x	Set of mixins to enable uni-directional data flow in Polymer application.*This library was developed as part of internal project at Google and isn't directly affiliated with the Polymer project  although Polymer team has provided some good feedback on UniFlow implementation .*
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	When you start working on a new Polymer application, it's easy to start and build the first few elements, and make them communicate via events and data binding, so everything looks nice and rosy
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	However, as the number and complexity of elements grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage relationships between them, trace where/when the data changes happened, and debug the problems
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	So this project started as an attempt by our team at Google to find a good way to architect large Polymer application
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	Inspired by React's community Flux  and, later, Redux  architecture, we implemented a unidirectional data flow pattern  data down, events up  for Polymer
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	We found that when using UniFlow application code becomes more streamlined  e.g
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	it is clear what the responsibilities of each element are  and much easier to manage; the code has fewer bugs, and debugging is a lot more efficient
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	Adding new functionality no longer exponentially increases complexity.This project was also inspired by Backbone Marionette
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	Backbone.js back in the days of its glory was a great library that provided a nice set of building blocks for building JavaScript applications
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	However, it left much of the application design, architecture and scalability to the developer, including memory management, view management, and more
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	Marionette brought an application architecture to Backbone, along with built in view management and memory management
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	It was designed to be a lightweight and flexible library of tools that sits on top of Backbone, providing the framework for building a scalable application
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	Uniflow strives to achieve similar goal for Polymer
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	We feel that Polymer, and web components in general, is a great concept that takes interoperability and encapsulation in Web development to the next level
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	But it lacked the patterns for building large and complex applications, and this is the void we expect UniFlow to fill
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	It is still in beta, so breaking changes may be happening before the first release
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	History & Overview	However, we believe that abstractions implemented in the library can be useful for Polymer community, so we encourage people to try, fork, ask questions, send  comments, and submit pull requests.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Applicability	This library implements the architectural pattern called 'unidirectional data flow'
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Applicability	It works best if application logic involves complicated data management, when multiple elements need to have access to or modify the same data
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Applicability	Even though the pattern can be implemented just using built-in Polymer concepts, such as custom events and data binding, the UniFlow library provides a useful set of tools and abstractions, and helps to structure application code.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Implementation	UniFlow is implemented as a set of mixins that developers apply to their elements
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Implementation	It is assumed that each application has a singleton application element that maintains state of entire application
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Implementation	Each element that needs access to the data is bound, directly or indirectly, to sub-tree of application state tree
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Implementation	Two way data binding is never used to send data up, from child to parent, so only parent elements send data to children using one way data binding
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Implementation	Child elements, in turn, send the events  emit actions  responding to user actions, indicating that the data may need to be modified
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Implementation	Special non-visual elements called action dispatchers mutate the data, then all elements listening to the data changes render new data
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Action Dispatcher	Use UniFlow.ActionDispatcher for non-visual elements that process actions emitted by visualelements
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Action Dispatcher	Action dispatchers usually placed at the application level
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Action Dispatcher	Each action dispatcherelement gets a chance to process the action in the order the elements are present in theDOM tree
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Action Dispatcher	It is important that action dispatcher elements get two-way data binding toapplication state as follows:Action dispatcher elements can include nested action dispatchers, so you can have ahierarchical organization of action dispatchers.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	HTML:	class MyElement extends UniFlow.StateAware Polymer.Element  {  }customElements.define MyElement.is, MyElement ;When above element is declared as follows:
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	JavaScript:	class MyApp extends UniFlow.ApplicationState Polymer.Element  {  }customElements.define MayApp.is, MyApp ;In the example above,  will receive notification of any changes to the state,as if it was declared as follows:the value of state.someElement.propertyA, and receive all notification of the property changewhenever the corresponding data in state tree changes
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	JavaScript:	This essentially translates to followingown state, it is considered their private state and no other elements will be notified of those
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Action Emitter	Whenever element needs to emit an action, this mixin should be used
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Action Emitter	Action object must always include type property.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Application State	Assign this mixin to your main application element
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Application State	It provides globalstate and functionality to maintain individual elements states
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Application State	This mixinis responsible for notifying all state-aware elements about their statechanges  provided those elements have statePath property defined .Only one element in the application is supposed to have this mixin.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	List View	This mixin used by elements that need to render multiple models backedby 'list' array
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	List View	You may want to use ModelView to render individualmodels in the list
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	List View	The mixin supports element selection by setting predefined$selected property on list elements.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	Element rendering data represented by a single object  model  in theapplication state should use ModelView mixin
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	Model View is a powerfulconcept that encapsulates model data  likely the data received from theserver and to be persisted to the server if modified as a result of useractions , status  validity of the data, flag that data was modified,notifications for the user, etc
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	Auxiliary data supplied by actiondispatchers and needed for display purposes or element's logicshould be defined as element’s properties
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	Same applies to datacreated/modified by the element but not intended to be persisted.If StateAware mixin is used along with ModelView, you can take advantageof statePath property that indicates path to the element's state in theapplication state tree
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	Whenever any data is mutated by action dispatchersat statePath or below, the element will receive notification of itsproperties' change  even if there is no explicit binding for thoseproperties 
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	See UniFlow.StateAware for more details and example.ModelView mixin defines some properties that are intended to be overriddenin the elements:+ validation property allows to specify validation rulesthat will be applied when validateModel   method is called
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	Model View	As a result ofthis method validation status will be updated to indicate result for eachmodel field that has validation rule associated with it.+ saveAction property indicates which action should be emitted whensaveModel method is called to perform save of the model.+ getMessage should be overridden with the function returning messagestring for given error code  to translate validation error code to message 
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	State Aware	 Key mixin that must be assigned to all elements that need to access application state and/or have access to the application element
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	State Aware	The element is notified of any changes to application's state, as well as all its properties when they're modified by state mutator elements
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	State Aware	state-path property must be used to identify path to element's state in application state tree.
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	State Mutator	Some non-visual elements, like action dispatchers, need to modify applicationstate, in which case they should have this mixin assigned
google-readmegoogle-uniflow-polymer.md	State Mutator	Implements stateare only supposed to exist at the application level.

google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	Which languages convey the most information in a given amount of space? This isa question often asked of linguists, especially by engineers who often have someinformation theoretic measure of "information" in mind, but rarely defineexactly how they would measure that information
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	The question is, in factremarkably hard to answer, and many linguists consider it unanswerable
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	But itis a question that seems as if it ought to have an answer
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	If one had a databaseof close translations between a set of typologically diverse languages, withdetailed marking of morphosyntactic and morphosemantic features, one could hopeto quantify the differences between how these different languages conveyinformation
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	Since no appropriate database exists we decided to constructone
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	The purpose of this paper is to present our work on the database, alongwith some preliminary results
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Abstract	We plan to release the dataset once complete.
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	Our data are taken from a few domains of interest to Google including drivingdirections and answers generated from structured data for Google Now™
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	 Notethat no Google user data is included in our data collection
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	  Obviously suchexamples are but a subset of the ways in which language is used to communicate:The reason for picking data from this circumscribed set of domains is that forpart of the data at least, the text corresponds to, and in a real applicationwould be automatically generated from, data in a defined format  see below foran example 
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	Therefore the basic intended meaning of a message is to a largeextent given, thus obviating the need to do semantic annotation
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	By producingparallel target sentences in various languages, and making sure that thetranslations are as close as possible, while still being stylistically andsocially acceptable, we can be minimize differences in information content thatmight arise for irrelevant reasons, such as liberal choices of wording taken bythe translators
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	We are therefore focusing as much as possible on what thelanguages must convey, rather than one what they may convey.Our initial dataset consists of 85 sentences from a mix of domains for thefollowing languages: English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Arabic, Koreanand Mandarin Chinese
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	These languages were chosen from among languages for whichwe have very good resources, to be somewhat typologically balanced, representinglanguages of the “isolating” or quasi-isolating type  English, Mandarin ,“inflectional”  French, Italian, German, Russian, Arabic  and “agglutinative”’ Korean 
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	We are also interested in languages with rich case systems  German,Russian, Korean , gender systems  French, Italian, German, Russian, Arabic ,anda variety of language families — four in this case.2 For the current dataset,translators were given the English original in a spreadsheet, and were given thefollowing instructions:This is a request for natural sounding and socially appropriate translationswhich should be inserted directly into the provided spreadsheet in the columnfor your language
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	 Important: There is no character restriction for thesetranslations
google-readmegoogle-unimorph.md	Per the paper	However, we want translations that are succinct as possible,natural sounding, and socially appropriate.

google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriPattern	UriPattern is an interface for classes that match and parse URIs, much like the  Pattern  pattern  is for Strings
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriPattern	It defines the methods bool matches Uri uri  and UriMatch match Uri uri 
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriPattern	pattern : 
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriMatch	UriMatch is the result of UriPattern.match  
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriMatch	It contains the parameters parsed out of a URI and the "rest" of the URI left over after parsing, which is useful for parsing a single URI with multiple relative URI patterns that form a hierarchy.
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	UriTemplate is an implementation of  RFC 6570 URI Templates  rfc6570 
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	URI Templates are useful for generating URIs from data
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	UriTemplates are created from a template string, and then expanded with data to generate a URI:URI templates are strings made up of fixed and variable parts
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	The variable parts are described with _expressions_, which are places within single curly-braces: { and }.Expressions consist of an optional _operator_ and a comma-separated list of _variable_specifications_
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	Variable specifications consist of a variable name and an optional _modifier_
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	The operator applies to the whole expression and controls how reserved characters are expanded, the prefix and separator, if any, applied to the expansion, and whether to expand the variable as a key/value pair
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriTemplate	Modifiers apply to each variable in the expression and allow truncating the value, or "exploding" list and maps into multiple key/value pairs.
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	Examples	URI template expansions does more than simple variable replacement, it has facilities for generating paths, fragments, query strings and more
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	Examples	To control the expansion, expressions can use one of the supported operators:| Operator | Description| _none_   | Simple string expansion| +| #| .| /| ;| ?| &
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	Modifiers	Modifiers control | Modifier | Description| _none_   | Default expansion| :_n_
google-readmegoogle-uri.dart.md	UriParser	UriParser parses URIs according to a UriTemplate, extracting paramaters based on the variables defined in the template.Since URI Templates are not designed to be parsable, only a restricted subset of templates can be used for parsing.Parsable templates have the following restrictions over expandable templates:UriBuilder is mutable container of URI components for incrementally building Uris.
google-readmegoogle-uribeacon.md	Project Status Update	We launched the UriBeacon project in 2014 to explore how to use BLE technology to share URLs
google-readmegoogle-uribeacon.md	Project Status Update	 Since then, we’ve been thrilled about the community that has formed around UriBeacon, and with the contributors and partners who have worked with us to produce UriBeacon utilities, apps, prototypes, and production-ready beacons.We’ve also found that in addition to broadcasting URLs, there is much more that can be accomplished with an open beacon format.To that end, **UriBeacon is evolving to become part of the  Eddystone open beacon format Like UriBeacon, Eddystone supports broadcasting URLs in BTLE advertisement packets via its  Eddystone-URL  frame type
google-readmegoogle-uribeacon.md	Project Status Update	 But unlike UriBeacon, Eddystone offers first class support for a variety of payload types
google-readmegoogle-uribeacon.md	Project Status Update	 Eddystone provides much better support for unique IDs via its  Eddystone-UID  frame, provides telemetry information via its  Eddystone-TLM  frame, and it opens the door for more future innovation
google-readmegoogle-uribeacon.md	Project Status Update	 Read the full  Protocol Specification There are some protocol changes to this new format, but this move should not impact much for the  Physical Web  project, which will support Eddystone-URL beacons.We look forward to continuing to work with you in the Eddystone-URL project!—The UriBeacon  and now Eddystone-URL  team

google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	VAE-Seq	VAE-Seq is a library for modeling sequences of observations.
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	One tool that's commonly used to model sequential data is theRecurrent Neural Network  RNN , or gated variations of it such as theLong Short-Term Memory cell or the Gated Recurrent Unit cell.RNNs in general are essentially trainable transition functions:Normal distributions for real-valued observations.The output of the RNN specifies the parameters of the observationdistribution  e.g
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	the logits of a Categorical or the mean andvariance of a Normal 
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	But the size of the RNN output and thenumber of parameters that we need don't necessarily match up
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	To solvethis, we project output into the appropriate shape via a NeuralNetwork we'll call a decoder.And what about the input of the RNN? It can be empty, but we mightwant to include side information from the environment  e.g
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	actionswhen modeling a game or a metronome when modelingmusic 
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	Additionally, the observation from the previous step s  isalmost always an important feature to include
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	Here, we'll use anotherNeural Network we'll call an encoder to summarize the observationinto a more digestible form.Together, these components specify a factored  by time step probability distribution that we can train in the usual way: bymaximizing the probability of the network weights given theobservations in your training data and your priors over thoseweights
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Background	Once trained, you can use ancestral sampling to generate new
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	This library allows you to express the type of model describedabove
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	It handles the plumbing for you: you define the encoder, thedecoder, and the observation distribution
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	The resulting model canbe trained on a Dataset of observation sequences, queried for theprobability of a given sequence, or queried to generate new sequences.But the model above also has a limitation: the family of observationdistributions we pick is the only source of non-determinism in themodel
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	If it can't express the true distribution of observations, themodel won't be able to learn or generate the true range of observationsequences
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	For example, consider a sequence of black/white images
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	Ifwe pick the observation distribution to be a set of independentBernoulli distributions over pixel values, the first generated imagewould always look like a noisy average over images in the trainingset
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	Subsequent images might get more creative since they areconditioned on a noisy input, but that depends on how images varybetween steps in the training data.The issue in the example above is that the observation distribution wepicked wasn't expressive enough: pixels in an image aren'tindependent
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	One way to fix this is to design very expressiveobservation distributions that can model images
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	Another way is tocondition the simple distribution on a latent variable to produce ahierarchical output distribution
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Motivation	This latter type of model is knownas a Variational Auto encoder  VAE .There are different ways to incorporate latent variables in asequential model  see the supported architectures below  but thegeneral approach we take here is to view the RNN state as acollection of stochastic and deterministic variables.
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Usage	To define a model, subclass ModelBase to define an encoder, adecoder, and the output distribution
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Usage	The decoder and outputdistribution are packaged together into a DistModule  see: vaeseq/codec.py  vaeseq/codec.py  .The following model architectures are currently available  see: vaeseq/vae  vaeseq/vae  : see:  vaeseq/hparams.py  vaeseq/hparams.py  
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Usage	You can select amongthe architectures above by setting the vae_type parameter.
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Examples	When you build and install this library via python setup.py install,the following example programs are installed as well
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Examples	See: vaeseq/examples  vaeseq/examples .
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	Text	A character-sequence model that can be used to generate nonsense textor to evaluate the probability that a given piece of text was writtenby a given author.To train on Andrej Karpathy's "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset:After training has completed, you can generate text:Or you can tell how likely a piece of text is to be Shakespearean:
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	MIDI	Similar to the text example above, but now modeling MIDI music specifically, piano rolls 
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	MIDI	Installed under vaeseq-midi
google-readmegoogle-vae-seq.md	MIDI	Don'texpect it to sound great.

google-readmegoogle-varstruct.md	Varstruct Overview	Varstruct creates struct-like types with runtime-computed array sizes.Varstruct is a header-only library -build config, just add varstruct.h and varstruct_internal.h to your includes.C-style struct definitions may have internal array fields; however, these fielddeclarations must specify the size of each array at compile time so that thecompiler may reserve enough space when computing the offset of each member andthe size of the struct.Unfortunately, many I/O protocols use headers with internal arrays whose size isspecified or computed based on other header fields
google-readmegoogle-varstruct.md	Varstruct Overview	Therefore, code that parsesthese headers often has to perform error-prone manual pointer manipulation.Varstruct is a C++11 library that creates types that may contains internalarrays, and the sizes of these arrays may be passed in at runtime
google-readmegoogle-varstruct.md	Varstruct Overview	Varstructthen computes offsets to each member, and can also read and modify fields whengiven an input pointer
google-readmegoogle-varstruct.md	Varstruct Overview	Modification is performed via std::memcpy   to avoid memory alignment problemsthat would otherwise occur accessing misaligned fields -any padding of its own .You can run the tests by running the following in the repo root directory  youwill need Google Bazel installed :bazel test :varstruct_testSee the comments in varstruct.h for more information.Author: Caleb Raitto

google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	Verilogpp User Manual	 idle" and "write1 ->write1" are implicit.
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	OPTIONS	If the "--enum" option is specified on the first line of the FSM macro, then anenum is used to generate the state variables instead of a bitvector and a setof localparam declarations.
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	INST {#Macro_INST}	The INST macro creates an instance of the specified module
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	INST {#Macro_INST}	 The"specifications" text of the INST macro can be used to specify parameters,and to indicate how port names should be mapped onto signal names.Parameters can be specified for the instantiated block like this:Transformation of port names onto signal names occurs by applying aset of transformation rules onto the port name to produce the signalname that port should connect to.The simplest transformation simply maps a port to a signal, like this:Alternately, a regular expression substitution can be performed on theport name to produce the signal name:The INST macro is often used in conjunction with the AUTONET macro toautomatically generate correct net declarations for all nets mapped onto theports of INST-instantiated submodules
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	INST {#Macro_INST}	 Additionally, the AUTOINTERFACE macrocan be used to propagate unbound ports from INST-instantiated submodules to themodule interface.See also: the AUTONET, AUTOINTERFACE, and FORINST macros.
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	PERL {#Macro_PERL}	*DEPRECATED*: Use the EXEC macro instead.This macro is expanded by evaluating an embedded perl script.The STDOUT produced by the embedded perl script is the generatedverilog code
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	PERL {#Macro_PERL}	 Think of it like a "generate" statement on steroids.This macro improves code by providing a more maintainablealternative to the copy-paste-edit cycle.
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	REG {#Macro_REG}	*DEPRECATED*: Use a macro instead.This macro provides a concise way to instantiate registers in a consistentfashion
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	REG {#Macro_REG}	 Register mapping is specified using a simple RTL syntax:Alternately, conditional loading of registers can be specified:Clock and reset default to "clock" and "reset_n" respectively, but canbe overridden with the "clk:" and "rst:" directives.
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	STRUCT {#Macro_STRUCT}	*DEPRECATED*: This macro was useful when working with Verilog-2001 code,but modern code should use SystemVerilog struct constructs.The STRUCT macro is used to concatenate a series of signalsinto a data-structure like bus, by defining a set of macrosto simplify the assembly and disassembly of that bus.Each line is a data member, optionally prefixed by a word size
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	STRUCT {#Macro_STRUCT}	 Ifword size is omitted, the data member is assumed to be a single bit wide.By default, fields in the structure are concatenated in order so thatthe first element is the least-signficant part of the structure
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	STRUCT {#Macro_STRUCT}	 Ifthe reverse order is preferred, supply the "--reverse" option to themacro declaration, and the first item will be the most significant partof the structure.Options: if the "--reverse" option is supplied to the macro declarationline, the fields of the structure are produced in reverse order  ie
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	STRUCT {#Macro_STRUCT}	firstitem is the most signficiant part of the packed structure word .
google-readmegoogle-verilogpp.md	TIEOUTPUTSTOZERO {#Macro_TIEOUTPUTSTOZERO}	This macro can be used to automatically tie all outputs of the currentmodule to zeroes, enabling quick creation of stub modules.For example:Expands to:
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Supported File-types	Use :FormatLines to format a range of lines or use :FormatCode to formatthe entire buffer.
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Usage example	This example uses  Vundle  whoseplugin-adding command is Plugin.to register formatters.
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Autoformatting	Want to just sit back and let autoformat happen automatically? Add this to yourvimrc  or any subset :Most formatters have some options available that can be configured via Glaive You can get a quick view of all codefmt flags by executing :Glaive codefmt, orstart typing flag names and use tab completion
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Autoformatting	See :help Glaive for usage
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Installing formatters	Codefmt defines several built-in formatters
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Installing formatters	The easiest way to see the list ofavailable formatters is via tab completion: Type :FormatCode  in vim.Formatters that apply to the current filetype will be listed first.To use a particular formatter, type :FormatCode FORMATTER-NAME
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Installing formatters	This willeither format the current buffer using the selected formatter or show an errormessage with basic setup instructions for this formatter
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Installing formatters	Normally you willtrigger formatters via key mappings and/or autocommand hooks
google-readmegoogle-vim-codefmt.md	Installing formatters	Seevroom/main.vroom to learn more about formatting features, and seevroom/FORMATTER-NAME.vroom to learn more about usage for individual formatters.

google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Commands	Use :CoverageToggle to toggle coverage visibility for the current file.
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Installation	This example uses  Vundle  whoseplugin-adding command is Plugin.detecting installed libraries.
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Using coverage providers	The easiest way to see the list of available providers is via tab completion:Type :CoverageShow  in vim.To use a particular provider, type :CoverageShow PROVIDER-NAME
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Using coverage providers	This willeither show coverage in the current buffer using the selected provider or showan error message if provider is not available
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Using coverage providers	Normally you will triggerproviders via key mappings and/or autocommand hooks.vim-coverage currently defines one coverage provider, a coverage.py provider forpython
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Using coverage providers	See  for other plannedCoverage offers a lot of customization on colors and signs rendered for coveredand uncovered lines
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Using coverage providers	You can get a quick view of all coverage flags by executing:help Glaive for usage details.
google-readmegoogle-vim-coverage.md	Defining custom providers	Any plugin wishing to be a coverage provider needs only to register itself usingMaktaba's registry feature, passing a dictionary of following format:
google-readmegoogle-vim-glaive.md	Usage example	This example uses  Vundle.vim  whoseplugin-adding command is Plugin
google-readmegoogle-vim-glaive.md	Usage example	Note that Vundle does not add plugins to theruntime path until vundle#end  , so Glaive commands must come after thisfunction call.We will use two plugins for demonstration:   maktaba set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vimcall vundle#begin  " Add maktaba, glaive, and codefmt to the runtimepath."  Glaive must also be installed before it can be used
google-readmegoogle-vim-glaive.md	Usage example	Plugin 'google/vim-maktaba'Plugin 'google/vim-glaive'Plugin 'google/vim-codefmt'vundle#end  filetype plugin indent on" Add helloworld to the runtime path
google-readmegoogle-vim-glaive.md	Usage example	 Normally this would be done with another" Plugin command, but helloworld doesn't have a repository of its own
google-readmegoogle-vim-glaive.md	Usage example	call maktaba#plugin#Install maktaba#path#Join  maktaba#Maktaba  .location,call glaive#Install  " Configure helloworld using glaive.Glaive helloworld plugin mappings  name='Bram'" Real world example: configure vim-codefmtGlaive codefmt google_java_executable='java -jar /path/to/google-java-format.jar'Now, Goodbye, Bram!

google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	syncopate	 **Syn** tax  **cop** y-p **a** s **te** .
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	What's it for?	To make sharing beautiful code as frictionless as possible.Say you have a nicely syntax-highlighted buffer in vim.This plugin lets you open a browser tab with that buffer's contents, including the highlighting.If you copy-paste into a webmail window, a Google Doc, etc., the syntax highlighting stays intact.Best of all, it cleans up after itself: it won't clutter your directories with .html files.
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	How do I install it?	Depends on your plugin manager.Note that syncopate is a  maktaba  plugin, so you will need to install maktaba  if your plugin manager doesn't handle dependencies .If you want to configure the plugin, we strongly recommend installing  glaive  as well.Here are instructions for Vundle, the most popular plugin manager.Add the following lines between your call vundle#begin   and call vundle#end   lines." Dependency; required for vim-syncopate.Plugin google/vim-maktaba" Strongly recommended: easy configuration of maktaba plugins.Plugin google/vim-glaivePlugin google/vim-syncopateSyncopate is expected to work on any platform vim supports, but the defaultconfiguration may not work on your system and direct-to-clipboard support hasn'tbeen implemented for some platforms
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	How do I install it?	Contributions welcome!
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	xclip	Syncopate requires xclip to manipulate the clipboard
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	xclip	 In most cases,installing it from your package manager should just work.Arch Linux's official repository has an xclip  0.12.4  which is too old: itdoesn't support --target
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	xclip	Arch users should install xclip-svn from AUR:
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	Use the clipboard directly	Use the :SyncopateExportToClipboard command.It populates the clipboard with the contents of your buffer  or just part of it, if you're in visual mode , including highlighting.You can then paste your beautiful code into a compose window  such as Gmail .Of course, it's even better with a keymapping, which you can enable using Glaive:" This line needs to go anywhere after 'call vundle#end  '.call glaive#Install  " Enable keymappings.Glaive syncopate plugin mappings By default, syncopate's mappings all start with the prefix The following examples will assume you're using the default prefix, and that your    is ,.
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	Put it in a browser window	Alternatively, you can use the :SyncopateExportToBrowser command.It opens the HTML in a new browser tab, so you can select regions interactively.Syncopate automatically cleans up the HTML file after opening the tab.If you use :SyncopateExportToBrowser, be sure to copy with Ctrl-C  as opposed to mouse selection/middle-click ; otherwise, the highlighting will not be retained.
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	How do I configure it?	There are a variety of syncopate-specific options: whether to change the colorscheme, which browser to use, etc.See :help syncopate-config.For everything else, use the built-in options for the :TOhtml command: :help 2html.vim
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	How do I configure it?	Options are down below, starting at :help g:html_diff_one_file
google-readmegoogle-vim-syncopate.md	How do I configure it?	For example, the following line will exclude line numbers from the output, even if you use them in vim:Mainly convenience.Under the hood, :SyncopateExportToClipboard will:Switch to the default colorscheme  it shows up better on white backgrounds .Create the HTML version of your vim buffer.Export it to the clipboard.Restore your colorscheme, and any other settings it needed to change.Simply running :TOhtml only does the second step.In particular, the third step is difficult to remember how to do.Without it, :TOhtml usually involves tiresome saving-and-subsequently-deleting of HTML files, and fiddling with a browser.

google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	Vimdoc understands -bang,-nargs, -range, -count, -register, and -buffer
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	 It ignores -bar
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	 It willparse out the arguments in the order that they are mentioned in the commentblock above the command and will generate a usage line for the command
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	Forexample, the following comment block:will generate the following usage line:You can override the usage line with the @usage command, which takes a list ofarguments
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	Any arguments that look like vim variable names  \I\i+  will beassumed to be parameters, and their required-ness will be inferred from thedocs
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	You can force required-ness by providing arguments that look like vimvariables wrapped in curly  required  or square  optional  brackets
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	Emptycurly brackets stand in for the remainder of the inferred required variables.Empty square brackets stand in for the remainder of the inferred optionalvariables
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	For example:For more advanced usage, you may use the @command directive
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	This is usefuleither when your command takes a non-standard argument list  like :substitute or when your command is not recognized by vimdoc  when you :execute 'command's:name .The @command directive takes one argument, which is the entire usage line
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	{}expands to all of the inferred required parameters,    to all of the inferredoptional parameters, and <> to the complete inferred command name with built-inflags included
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	For example:generates the usage line:An argument which may be given multiple times should be suffixed with anellipsis
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	For example, {arg...} documents an argument that may appear once ormore and  arg..
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	 denotes an argument that may appear zero or more times.Sometimes you want a command to have more than one usage
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	For that you may usemore than one usage directive
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	Example:This will generate two docs for the command: one for list, one for dicts
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	An@all directive denotes that the remainder of the block will be included in allusages
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Commands	In the above example, the warning will be included in both the list andthe dict version of the command docs.
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Dictionaries	Vimscript kinda-sorta supports object oriented programming via dictionarieswith functions attached
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Dictionaries	 See :help Dictionary-function
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Dictionaries	 Vimdoc helps yougroup these dictionaries and their methods in one place in the documentation.You may describe a dictionary object type using the @dict annotation ina comment block that is above a blank line
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Dictionaries	Then you may annotate thedictionary functions with the @dict directive to have them grouped with thedictionary description
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Dictionaries	 Such functions will not be listed in the functionssection
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Functions	Function documentation is very similar to command documentation.The order of required parameters is inferred by looking at the functionThe order of optional parameters is inferred by the order they are mentioned inthe comment block
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Functions	Use the @usage command as described in the Command sectionto correct the order of optional arguments.Functions may have multiple usages just like commands
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Functions	Functions are notexposed in the help docs by default
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Functions	Use @public to make them public by@function can be used to tell vimdoc about a non-obvious function  such as onecreated by :execute 
google-readmegoogle-vimdoc.md	Functions	  , {}, and    expand as in @command.
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Browser Action Icon	The browser action icon is actually created via a  element
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Browser Action Icon	Thisallows rendering the desktop number on the icon on-the-fly without needing oneimage file per supported desktop.
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Moving Chrome Windows	To reposition an existing window, the chrome.windows  API isused
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Moving Chrome Windows	However, one can't just call chrome.windows.update   on an existingwindow and expect the position and size to "just work"! The problem is thatespecially on X11, the window manager will add window borders and title bars tothe Chrome-specified target window size
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Moving Chrome Windows	So to actually achieve the desiredposition, the following approach is taken:  requested the size change from the window manager, but before the window  manager actually performed the action! In fact, on X11, the window manager  can even silently ignore the request, so there is no safe way for Chrome to  just "wait till the window manager is done".Note that this will allow a window to overlap its neighboring window's borders.This is intentional to save some space on the screen
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Moving Chrome Windows	It should not be possiblefor a window to actually overlap into a neighboring window's content area.No Chrome permissions are required for this action.
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Extracting Tabs to New Windows	To turn an existing window into a tab, the currentWindow.There are some pitfalls here too, though:  special cases, we instead create the window without a size specification, and  move it into place using chrome.windows.update   as in the previous  section
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Extracting Tabs to New Windows	 pass throgh the tab's incognito property to the chrome.windows.create    call.No Chrome permissions are required for this action.
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	There is currently no way in ChromeOS to manage virtual desktops a window ison
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	So how can we possibly do this? Essentially using the same approach existing software  can use to provide thesame feature on Windows.Essentially, what this means is:Of course, there are pitfalls when doing this too:  switching away from its desktop
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	 without specifying a target size, and then run a second round setting the  window positions
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	 position and size is persisted into localStorage.No Chrome permissions are required for this action.-----------  not necessary
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	 window is on  already and not just when releasing the keys like what happens on most X11  window managers
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	 empty desktop would no longer allow you to switch to a non-empty one
google-readmegoogle-virtualdesktops-extension.md	Managing Virtual Desktops	Thus  empty desktops will be skipped when switching between desktops, and closing  the last remaining Chrome window on a desktop will automatically switch to  another, non-empty, desktop.-------The code is released unser the Apache 2.0 license

google-readmegoogle-vk_callback_swapchain.md	Vulkan Callback Swapchain	See the CONTRIBUTING.md  CONTRIBUTING.md  file for more information
google-readmegoogle-vk_callback_swapchain.md	Vulkan Callback Swapchain	See also the AUTHORS  AUTHORS  and  CONTRIBUTORS  CONTRIBUTORS  files.If an application inserts this layer, either by explicitly enabling thislayer, or through environment variables, the default swapchain mechanism isreplaced
google-readmegoogle-vk_callback_swapchain.md	Vulkan Callback Swapchain	All of the existing platform-specific swapchain and surface callsremain valid
google-readmegoogle-vk_callback_swapchain.md	Vulkan Callback Swapchain	However instead of creating a swapchain thatrenders to the given native surface, a virtual swapchain will be created.The following calls are intercepted.It follows that a Valid native surface is not required.Any window/module/connection parameters are ignored
google-readmegoogle-vk_callback_swapchain.md	Vulkan Callback Swapchain	This can be used forexample to allow an application that typically renders to a window tobe run without a window.The following method is additionally exported by the layer.This function allows the user to set a callback function to be called when aswapchain image has been scheduled for presentation
google-readmegoogle-vk_callback_swapchain.md	Vulkan Callback Swapchain	The parametersto the provided callback are the originally supplied user_data, apointer to the bytes that would have been output, and the number of bytes

google-readmegoogle-vmregistry.md	Accessing VMRegistry	VMRegistry auth is based on JWT as provided by  credstore  Consultcredstore documentation on how to generate a token.There's no RBAC at the moment, so anyone holding a valid token has full accessto the vmregistry, possibly meaning a transitive root access to the host nodevia libvirt.
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Vogon: scalable customization of video campaigns	Vogon combines a video creative, a data table and a layout specification,generating a copy of the video creative combined with each line of the datatable according to the layout specification.The data can contain text and images
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Vogon: scalable customization of video campaigns	The specification determines the timing,position and font definitions for each piece of text and image, referencingdata fields through their names
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Vogon: scalable customization of video campaigns	Fixed text can also be used in the layoutThe generated videos are  optionally  uploaded to a Youtube channel, and a campaign specification file is generated to be imported in AdWords for Video,creating geo-targeted campaigns for each of the videos.This is not an official Google product.
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Dependencies	In order to run Vogon, you need to have the following installed first:Vogon can upload videos to Youtube using the Youtube API and help you create AdWords for Video campaigns
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Dependencies	In order to do that, you need to complete the steps below.Create a project in the  Google Developers Console   In the Console, create a new project with the "Create Project" button  Click "Enable an API" and activate the "Youtube Data V3" API  In "APIs and Auth -> Credentials", create a new Client ID for a installed application  Download the JSON file with the "Download JSON" button, and save it in the directory where you will run Vogon  together with your configuration, data and image files   The account that manages the Youtube channel and the AdWords account must both have Edit access to the project, which can be configured in the "Permissions" section of the ConsoleThe Youtube and AdWords accounts must be linked 
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	Vogon configuration files are  JSON documents  Two samples are included with the source, a version for  Unix-like systems  and another for  Windows  You can use one of these as a starting point for your project.In most values, you can use variables to insert values from the input CSV
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	For example, you can use the location name from the CSV to specify the geo-targeting for the campaigns.The syntax for variables is {{column name}}, where "column name" is the name in the CSV header
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	For example, if your CSV looks like this:City | PriceSão Paulo | 48.900,00Curitiba | 49.900,00You can configure geo-targeting like this:"Location": "{{city}}"Column names are case-insensitive  e.g
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	"City" and "city" both work .Vogon pre-defines some special variables that don't come from the CSV:{{$id}}: a sequential line number of the record in the CSV file  starting at 1, after the header 
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	It can be useful to generate video files with unique names, for example.{{$video_id}}: After a video is uploaded to YouTube, this is the video ID
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	It can be used for linking to the video
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Configuration	The "Video Id" ad attribute in the output CSV is automatically set to this value.
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Importing the Campaigns	Vogon will generate a CSV file that can be imported into AdWords for Video, containing all the new campaigns, ads and targeting for the generated videos
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Importing the Campaigns	This file can be modified with a text editor or spreadsheet application  like LibreOffice or Excel , if necessary, or imported as is.If you want to insert ads into existing campaigns, you'll need to obtain the campaign ID
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Importing the Campaigns	To do that, click the "Bulk Upload" button, choose the "Only Data" option and click "Download"
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Importing the Campaigns	The generated file will contain the campaign ID numbers.
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Reference	AdWords for Video bulk upload documentation: 
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Location Codes	Location names need to be followed by their codes, which can be looked up in this page:  The prefix "47-" needs to be added to the code that you look up from the page.For example:If the codes are present, the names are not really important, as the system will use the code to look up the location
google-readmegoogle-vogon.md	Location Codes	If the code is absent, the system will try to find the location by name, but this is unreliable and can lead to missing or incorrect locations.
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder	Voice Builder is an opensource text-to-speech  TTS  voice building tool thatfocuses on simplicity, flexibility, and collaboration
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder	Ourtool allows anyone with basic computer skills to run voice training experimentsand listen to the resulting synthesized voice.We hope that this tool will reduce the barrier for creating new voices andaccelerate TTS research, by making experimentation faster andinterdisciplinary collaboration easier
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder	We believe that our tool can helpimprove TTS research, especially for low-resourced languages,where more experimentations are often needed to get the most out of the limited
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Prerequisites	Create a project on  Google Cloud Platform  GCP  Enable billing and request more quota for your projectInstall  Docker Go to  firebase.com  and import the project to firebase platformInstall gcloud cmd line tool by installing  CloudInstall  Node.js Install  firebase cmd line tool Enable all the following GCP services:		GCP will bring you to another page to set credentials for these
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Prerequisites	Optional  Setup your own  custom data exporter 
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Deployment	> If you have not completed all prerequisites, please do so before going further in the following steps.Clone this project to your current directory by:If you haven't logged in to your account via gcloud yet, please log in by:Also, if you haven't logged in to your account via firebase , please log in by:Open deploy.sh and edit the following variables:Create GCS buckets for Voice Builder to store each job dataDeploy cloud functions componentDeploy ui component
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Create an example voice	At this step, you should have all components in place and can access the UI  at  VoiceBuilder initially provides you with two  example TTS engines   Festival   and  Merlin  and public data  from  language resources repo   yourself using our provided Festival engine by:  Access  and go to a create-voice form by clicking  You will see a form where you can choose different TTS engines and input  Click on "JOBS" tab
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Create an example voice	Now, you should see a new job that you have just  After an hour, you should see "Completed Voice Model Deployment" under
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	Data Exporter is another additional component you can add to the system.Normally, Voice Builder can work without Data Exporter
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	Without it,Voice Builder would just use the input files as they are.However, in some cases you want to apply some conversion to your input filesbefore feeding them into TTS algorithms
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	For example:can use to manipulate data before running the actual TTS algorithm
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	Your customdata exporter will get a  Voice Specification containing file location, chosen TTS algorithm, tuning parameters, etc
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	You can use these information tomanipulate/convert your data
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	In the end, your data exporter should put allnecessary files into the designated job folder to trigger the actual TTS algorithm to run.Firstly, you need to give your data exporter access to GCS buckets.Open /deploy.sh and edit the following variables:Run command to give DATA_EXPORTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT an ACL access to GCS bucketsOpen /config.js and add DATA_EXPORTER_API to the config as follows:Redeploy Voice Builder UI instance so that it now has a new config and knows  where to send Voice Specification info
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	 Optional  Using Custom Data Exporter	to your data exporterTry to create a new job! Voice Builder should now send a request to your DATA_EXPORTER_URL	with the created job's Voice Specification.
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder specification	VoiceBuildingSpecification is a JSON definition of the voice specification
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder specification	This specification is created by the Voice Builder backend when a user triggers a voice building request from the UI
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder specification	 It can be used by the data exporter  passed to the data exporter via its API  to convert files and by the TTS engine for its training parameters.id | Unique global job id.voice_name | User friendly voice name  e.g
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder specification	multi speaker voice .created_by | The name of the user who created the voice.job_folder | The path to the GCS job folder
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder specification	This is where all the data related to the job is store.lexicon_path | Path to the lexicon.phonology_path | Path to the phonology.wavs_path | Path to the wavs  should be a tar file .wavs_info_path | Path to the file containing mapping of wav name and prompts.sample_rate | Sample rate at which the voice should be built.tts_engine | Type of TTS engine to train the voice
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Voice Builder specification	The value for this would be the engine_id from the selected TTS engine engine.json.engine_params | The additional parameters for tts engine.
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	EngineParam	-----------key | Parameter key.value | Value for the parameter key.
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Path	-----------path | Path to the file.file_type | Format of the file.
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Example	For example, if you set up your data exporter, when you create a voiceusing our predefined Festival engine, Voice Builder will send the requestbody similar to below to your data exporter
google-readmegoogle-voice-builder.md	Example	Your data exporter then haveto pre-process data and put them in job_folder location which is gs://your-voice-builder-jobs/1 in this example .After all necessary files are placed in the folder, the actual voice buildingprocess will begin automatically as expected.

google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Introduction	But the templates providedcan be used for a variety of purposes, including doing a self-assessmentof your own security program, or simply becoming familiar with issuesaffecting the security of web applications.To test the application without deploying it, go to e.g., *Assessment target*Assessment targetto export the answers.*Assessment targetfrom *assessment target*.
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Project Structure	---VSAQ includes an easy-to-use setup script called do.sh
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Project Structure	It supports thefollowing commands:To build VSAQ, run the following commands:./do.sh build
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Local Development Server	To run the VSAQ development server locally, use the run command:./do.sh runNote that the development app server uses a snapshot of the code, takenat the time you run it
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Local Development Server	If you make changes to the code, be sure to run theappropriate build command again and restart the dev server:
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Deployment	The open source version of VSAQ does not require a dedicated back end
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Deployment	This meansVSAQ can be hosted as a static application on any web server.To deploy VSAQ, complete the following steps:./do.sh build_prod — This will run a normal build, but will also removetest files.Copy the content of the build directory into any directory hosted on yourweb server.The questionnaire should now be available underhttps:// yourserver /vsaq.html?qpath=questionnaires/test_template.json---code to run on a back end
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Deployment	All operations are performed by vsaq_main.js in theAlthough this makes deployment very easy, you may want to run a customserver-side component for storing answers and mapping questionnairesto users
google-readmegoogle-vsaq.md	Deployment	vsaq_main.js provides example code for submitting and loading questionnaireanswers to/from a back end:build/vsaq_binary.js.Closure Templates are compiled by the Closure Template Compilerand placed in build/templates/vsaq/static/questionnaire/templates.soy.js.The /questionnaires directory and parts of the /static directories arereplicated in build/.Changes to the JSON /questionnaires do not require redeployment of theapplication code, and can be done on the server if required.

google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Web Activities JavaScript library	It’s a common task for a web page to open a different page  an iframe, a popup or a redirect  that will return its result back to the calling page
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Web Activities JavaScript library	The typical use cases include location picker, contact picker, payment form, social sign-in, and so on.While many platforms provide an easy and reliable APIs to accomplish this, Web platform does not
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Web Activities JavaScript library	The Web Activities library provides a common API to do this.
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Key concepts	The API provides two parts: a client  or port  and a host
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Key concepts	A host page implements the actual activity and a client page opens the host and waits for the result to be returned.
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Client API  ports 	These APIs are provided within the ActivityPorts class.A client page can open the activity as an iframe or a standalone page.To open the activity as an iframe:To open the activity as a standalone page  popup or redirect :// First setup callback, even if you are not yet starting an activity
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Client API  ports 	This// will ensure that you are always prepared to handle redirect results.ports.onResult resultId, port => {  port.acceptResult  .then result => {  } ;} ;// Open the activity.ports.open resultId, url, target, args, options ;For details options, see ActivityOpenOptionsDef type.
google-readmegoogle-web-activities.md	Host API  hosts 	These APIs are provided within the ActivityHosts class.A host page implements the activity by connecting it to the client:activities.connectHost  .then host => {  // Check origin properties

google-readmegoogle-webview-local-server.md	Overview	The purpose of this library is to enable hosting local content  such as assetsor resources  under an http s :// URL
google-readmegoogle-webview-local-server.md	Overview	 The traditional way to access local resources is to use file:///android_assetor file://android_res/ URLs but using the file: scheme poses problems with  the Same-Origin policy  andmakes it problematic to reference local content from content loaded overa secure  https:  connection.
google-readmegoogle-webview-local-server.md	Usage	Using the WebView-Local-Server requires the following steps:Create a WebViewLocalServer instance.Tell the server where to host the resources.Hook up the server in the shouldInterceptRequest method.Consider using the following settings in order to maximize security:
google-readmegoogle-webview-local-server.md	Picking a domain.	One potential problem of hosting local resources on a http s :// URL is thatdoing so may conflict with a real website
google-readmegoogle-webview-local-server.md	Picking a domain.	This means that local resourcesshould only be hosted on domains that the user has control of or which havebeen dedicated for this purpose
google-readmegoogle-webview-local-server.md	Picking a domain.	 The androidplatform.net domain has been specifically reserved for thispurpose and you are free to use it.By default the hostResources.Should using a random subdomain be inconvenient for some reason it is possibleto use a fixed domain  like androidplatform.net or a domain you own .

google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	About	It enables XPath evaluation for HTML documents in every browser
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	About	We believe it to be the fastest XPath implementation available in JavaScript.

google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	Building it Yourself	We use Gulp:You can also run src/compile.sh if you want to use different versions ofClosure Compiler / Closure Library.
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	Wicked Good XPath started as a Google Closure port of the JavaScript-XPath project by Cybozu Labs
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	At the time, JavaScript-XPath was the fastest JavaScript implementation of XPath available --While it was fast, the code fell out of maintenance  last update was in 2007  so bugs were tough to get fixed
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	Also, since it wasn't written in Google Closure, it was tricky for us Googlers to integrate into our JavaScript applications
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	A rewrite was necessary.However, we went beyond merely porting the library to Google Closure and fixing a couple bugs
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	We identified some significant additional performance improvements, such that our version runs about 30% faster than the original
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	On top of that, the Closure compiler was able to minify our code down to a mere 25K, 40% smaller than JavaScript-XPath's 42K  though it has grown a bit since 
google-readmegoogle-wicked-good-xpath.md	History	Finally, the code is structured and documented in a way that we believe will make future maintenance quicker and easier.

google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	  Formerly known asPuffs Parsing Untrusted File Formats Safely .Wuffs is a domain-specific language and library for wrangling untrusted fileformats safely
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	Wrangling includes parsing, decoding and encoding
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	Examples ofsuch file formats include images, audio, video, fonts and compressed archives.Unlike the C programming language, Wuffs is safe with respect to bufferoverflows, integer arithmetic overflows and null pointer dereferences
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	The keydifference between Wuffs and other memory-safe languages is that all suchchecks are done at compile time, not at run time
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	*If it compiles, it is safe*,with respect to those three bug classes.The aim is to produce software libraries that are as safe as Go or Rust,roughly speaking, but as fast as C, and that can be used anywhere C librariesare used
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	This includes very large C/C++ products, such as popular web browsersand operating systems  using that term to include desktop and mobile userinterfaces, not just the kernel .The trade-off in aiming for both safety and speed is that Wuffs programs takelonger for a programmer to write, as they have to explicitly annotate theirprograms with proofs of safety
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	A statement like y is not zero.Wuffs is not a general purpose programming language
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely	While technicallypossible, it is unlikely that a Wuffs compiler would be worth writing in Wuffs.

google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	Decoding untrusted data, such as images downloaded from across the web, have along history of security vulnerabilities
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	As of 2017, libpng is over 18 yearsold, and the  PNG specification is dated 2003  butthat well examined C library is still getting  CVE's published in2017 Sandboxing and fuzzing can mitigate the danger, but they are reactions to C'sfundamental unsafety
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	Newer programming languages remove entire classes ofpotential security bugs
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	Buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences areamongst the most well known.Less well known are integer overflow bugs
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	Offset-length pairs, defining asub-section of a file, are seen in many file formats, such as OpenType fontsand PDF documents
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	A conscientious C programmer might think to check that asection of a file or a buffer is within bounds by writing if  offset + length's memset function.If your C/C++ project is large, you might want both the .c files  adding eachto your build system  and the .h files
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	If your C/C++ project is small, youmight only need the .c files, not the .h files, as the .c files are designed tobe a  drop-in library For example, if you want a GIF decoder, you only need gif.c
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	See TODO for anexample
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	More complicated decoders might require multiple .c files modules
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Background	For example, the PNG codec  TODO  requires the deflate codec, but theyare separate files, since HTTP can use also deflate compression  also known asgzip or zlib, roughly speaking  without necessarily processing PNG images.
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	If you want to modify the Wuffs standard library, or compile your own Wuffscode, you will need to do a little more work, and will have to install at leastthe Go toolchain in order to build the Wuffs tools
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	To run the test suite, youmight also have to install C compilers like clang and gcc, as well as Clibraries  and their .h files  like libjpeg and libpng, as some tests comparethat Wuffs produces exactly the same output as these other libraries.Running go get -v github.com/google/wuffs/cmd/..
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	will download and installthe Wuffs tools
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	Change get to install to re-install those programs withoutdownloading, e.g
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	after you've modified their source code, or after a manuallyissued git pull
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	The Wuffs tools that you'll most often use are wuffsfmt analogous to clang-format, gofmt or rustfmt  and wuffs  roughlyanalogous to make, go or cargo .You should now be able to run wuffs test
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Getting Deeper	If all goes well, you should seesome output containing the word "PASS" multiple times.
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Poking Around	Feel free to edit the std/lzw/decode_lzw.wuffs file, which implements the GIFLZW decoder
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Poking Around	After editing, run wuffs gen std/gif or wuffs test std/gif tore-generate the C edition of the Wuffs standard library's GIF codec, andoptionally run its tests.Try deleting an assert statement and re-running wuffs gen
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Poking Around	The result shouldbe syntactically valid, but a compile error, as some bounds checks can nolonger be proven.Find the line wuffs gen should fail, as the computation can underflow.Similarly, replacing the line var n_bits u32 with var n_bits u32 = 10should fail, as an n_bits < 8 assertion, a pre-condition, a few lines furtherdown again cannot be proven.Similarly, changing the 4095 in var prev_code u32 ..4095  either higher orlower should fail.Try adding assert false at various places, which should obviously fail, butshould also cause wuffs gen to print what facts the compiler can prove atthat point
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Poking Around	This can be useful when debugging why Wuffs can't prove somethingyou think it should be able to.
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Running the Tests	If you've changed any of the tools  i.e
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Running the Tests	changed any .go code , re-run goinstall -v github.com/google/wuffs/cmd/..
google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Running the Tests	and go testIf you've changed any of the libraries  i.e

google-readmegoogle-wuffs.md	Running the Tests	Themimic benchmark numbers should't change if you're only changing .wuffs code,but seeing zero change in those numbers is a sanity check on any unrelatedsystem variance, such as software updates or virus checkers running in the

google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Project Wycheproof	The smaller the mountain the more likely it is to be able toclimb it.* TOC 
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Project Wycheproof tests crypto libraries against known attacks
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	It is developedand maintained by members of Google Security Team, but it is not an officialGoogle product.At Google, we rely on many third party cryptographic software libraries.Unfortunately, in cryptography, subtle mistakes can have catastrophicconsequences, and we found that libraries fall into such implementationpitfalls much too often and for much too long
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Good implementation guidelines,however, are hard to come by: understanding how to implement cryptographysecurely requires digesting decades' worth of academic literature
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	We recognizethat software engineers fix and prevent bugs with unit testing, and we foundthat cryptographic loopholes can be resolved by the same means.These observations have prompted us to develop Project Wycheproof, a collectionof unit tests that detect known weaknesses or check for expected behaviors ofsome cryptographic algorithm
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Project Wycheproof provides tests for mostcryptographic algorithms, including RSA, elliptic curve crypto andauthenticated encryption
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Our cryptographers have systematically surveyed theliterature and implemented most known attacks
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	We have over 80 test cases whichhave uncovered more than  40 bugs  doc/bugs.md 
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Forexample, we found that we could recover the private key of widely-used DSA andECDHC implementations.While we are committed to develop as many attacks as possible, ProjectWycheproof is by no means complete
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Passing the tests does not imply that thelibrary is secure, it just means that it is not vulnerable to the attacks thatProject Wycheproof tests for
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Cryptographers are also constantly discoveringnew attacks
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Introduction	Nevertheless, with Project Wycheproof developers and users now cancheck their libraries against a large number of known attacks, without havingto spend years reading academic papers or become cryptographers themselves.For more information on the goals and strategies of Project Wycheproof, pleasecheck out our  doc  doc/ .
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Coverage	Project Wycheproof has tests for the most popular crypto algorithms, includingcryptographic interface
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Coverage	This allowed us to test multiple providers with asingle test suite
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Coverage	While this interface is somewhat low level, and should notbe used directly, we still apply a "defense in depth" argument and expect thatthe implementations are as robust as possible
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Coverage	For example, we consider weakdefault values to be a significant security flaw
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Coverage	We are converting as manytests into sets of test vectors to simplify porting the tests to otherlanguages
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Coverage	We provide ready-to-use test runners for Java CryptographyArchitecture providers such as  Bouncy Castle  Spongy Castle  and the defaultproviders in  OpenJDK 
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Usage	bazel test BouncyCastleAllTests_you change the WYCHEPROOF_BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR environment variable, run bazelclean to force a rebuild:refuse to run or its results might be incorrect if you are using some other JDK.If you downloaded your JDK from Oracle or  you're probablyusing Oracle JDK, which should be compatible with OpenJDK, thus the tests shouldrun correctly.Some tests take a very long time to finish
google-readmegoogle-wycheproof.md	Usage	If you want to exclude them, useBouncyCastleTest, SpongyCastleTest or OpenJDKTest -slow tests  which are annotated with @SlowTest .Most test targets are failing, and each failure might be a security issue

google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Getting started	You'll also need a front-end, from the list
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Building the core	Xi targets 'recent stable Rust'
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Building the core	We recommend installing via  rustup The current minimum supported version is 1.To build the xi editor from the root directory of this repo:protocol, but perhaps could be revitalized:experimental GL-based front-end in Rust.documentation at this point  on the protocol at frontend.md  If you're working on a front-end, feel free tosend a PR to add it to the above list.
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	Here are some of the design decisions, and motivation why they shouldcontribute to the above goals:  responsible for all potentially expensive editing operations
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	 On Mac, that’s Cocoa
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	 performance is possible in C++, but Rust offers a much more reliable, and  in many ways, higher level programming platform
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	 clients  thread with a snapshot of the current editor buffer  the persistent rope  data structure is copy-on-write so this operation is nearly free , which can  then proceed to write out to disk at its leisure, while the buffer is still  fully editable
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	 both more arcane and less powerful than “real” languages
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	The xi editor will  communicate with plugins through pipes, letting them be written in any  language, and making it easier to integrate with other systems such as  version control, deeper static analyzers of code, etc
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	 considered binary formats, but the actual improvement in performance would  be completely in the noise
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Design decisions	Using JSON considerably lowers friction for  developing plug-ins, as it’s available out of the box for most modern  languages, and there are plenty of the libraries available for the other  ones.
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Current status	This is still a project in its early stages
google-readmegoogle-xi-editor.md	Current status	The Mac build has basic editingfunctionality  it was used to write this README , but looks very spare andis still missing essentials such as auto-indent

google-readmegoogle-xi-win.md	Xi editor for Windows	This project is currently a seedling, which I am hopeful will growinto a useful front-end for  xi editor It makes some decisions which are fairly unusual for GUI softwarewritten in It targets winapi directly, rather than using atoolkit, and is written in Rust
google-readmegoogle-xi-win.md	Xi editor for Windows	The main reason is so that we cantarget performance; winapi has api's for Direct2D rendering that mayenable significantly lower latency and smoother scrolling thanaccessible through a toolkit
google-readmegoogle-xi-win.md	Xi editor for Windows	Part of the reason for taking on thisproject is to quantify the relative performance.Other important dimensions of performance are startup speed andexecutable size.Given the goals of this project and the  current  flux in the xiprotocol, I expect the focus of this project to be input and renderingpipelines, with less emphasis on features; it may be a while beforethis is really useful as an editor

google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	About XSecureLock	However, in the past they often hadsecurity issues regarding authentication bypass  a crashing screen locker wouldunlock the screen , information disclosure  notifications may appear on top ofthe screen saver , or sometimes even worse.In XSecureLock, security is achieved using a modular design to avoid the usualpitfalls of screen locking utility design on XDetails are available in the Security Design  #security-design  section.
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Requirements	The following packages need to be installed; their names depend on your Linuxdistribution of choice, but will be similar:NOTE: In these instructions, please replace SERVICE-NAME by the name of anappropriate and existing file in common-auth would work
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Requirements	This will be used as default and can be overriddenwith  XSECURELOCK_PAM_SERVICE  #options .Configuring a broken or missing SERVICE-NAME will render unlocking the screenimpossible! If this should happen to you, switch to another terminal Ctrl-Alt-F1 , log in there, and run: killall xsecurelock to force unlockingof the screen.Pick one of the  authentication modules  #authentication-modules  and one of the screen saver modules  #screen-saver-modules .Tell your desktop environment to run XSecureLock by using a command line such asone of the following:
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Automatic Locking	To automatically lock the screen after some time of inactivity, use xss-lock  as follows:the screen saver is active short time after wakeup!NOTE: When using xss-lock, it's recommended to not launch xsecurelockdirectly for manual locking, but to manually lock using xset s activate
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Automatic Locking	Thisensures that xss-lock knows about the locking state and won't try again, whichwould spam the X11 error log.WARNING: Never rely on automatic locking for security, for the followingAutomatic locking should merely be seen as a fallback for the case of the userforgetting to lock explicitly, and not as a security feature
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Automatic Locking	If you really wantto use this as a security feature, make sure to kill the session wheneverattempts to lock fail  in which case xsecurelock will return a non-zero exitstatus .
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	xautolock	xautolock can be used instead of xss-lock as long as you do not care forsuspend events  like on laptops :Ideally, an environment integrating xsecurelock should provide the following Wait for one of the following events: Repeat.This is, of course precisely what xss-lock does, and handling As an alternative, we also support this way of integrating: Wait for one of the following events: Repeat.NOTE: When using dimmer, please set XSECURELOCK_DIM_TIME_MS and XSECURELOCK_WAIT_TIME_MS tomatch the time your dimming tool takes for dimming, and how long you want towait in dimmed state before locking.
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Options	Options to XSecureLock can be passed by environment variables:Additionally, command line arguments following a "--" argument will be executedvia execvp once locking is successful; this can be used to notify a callingprocess of successful locking.
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Authentication Modules	The following authentication modules are included:
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Writing Your Own Module	The screen saver module is a separate executable, whose name must start withsaver_ and be installed together with the included auth_ modules  defaultlocation: /usr/local/libexec/xsecurelock/helpers .
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Screen Saver Modules	The following screen saver modules are included:
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Security Design	In order to achieve maximum possible security against screen lock bypassexploits, the following measures are taken:
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Known Security Issues	Most these issues are inherent with X11 and can only really be fixed bymigrating to an alternative such as Wayland; some of the issues  in particularthe gamepad input issue  will probably persist even with Wayland.
google-readmegoogle-xsecurelock.md	Forcing Grabs	As a workaround to the issue of another window already holding a grab, we offeran XSECURELOCK_FORCE_GRAB option.This adds a last measure attempt to force grabbing by iterating through allsubwindows of the root window, unmapping them  which closes down their grabs ,then taking the grab and mapping them again.This has the following known issues:

google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Requirements	You should be able to see the source code directory if yourun 'ls'.As you are developing your own models, you will want to test themquickly to flush out simple problems without having to submit them to the cloud.You can use the gcloud beta ml local set of commands for that.Here is an example command line for video-level training:allow you to work offline
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Requirements	The command below will copy 10 out of the 4096training data files to the current directory.Once you download the files, you can point the job to them using the'train_data_pattern' argument  i.e
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Requirements	instead of pointing to the "gs://..."files, you point to the local files .Once your model is working locally, you can scale up on the Cloudwhich is described below.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Video-level	mkdir -p ~/yt8m/v2/videocd ~/yt8m/v2/videocurl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=2/video/train mirror=us pythoncurl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=2/video/validate mirror=us pythoncurl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=2/video/test mirror=us python
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Frame-level	mkdir -p ~/yt8m/v2/framecd ~/yt8m/v2/framecurl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=2/frame/train mirror=us pythoncurl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=2/frame/validate mirror=us pythoncurl data.yt8m.org/download.py | shard=1,100 partition=2/frame/test mirror=us pythonNote: this readme will assume the directory ~/yt8m for storing the dataset,code, and trained models
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Frame-level	However, you can use another directory path.Nonetheless, you might find it convenient to simlink that directory to ~/yt8mso that you can copy the commands from this page onto your terminal
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Frame-level	If you are located outside of North America, you should change the flag 'mirror' to 'eu' for Europe or 'asia' for Asia to speed up the transfer of the files.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Try the starter code	Clone this git repo:
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training on Video-Level Features	Note: Above binary runs "forever"  i.e
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training on Video-Level Features	keeps watching for updated modelcheckpoint and re-runs evals 
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training on Video-Level Features	To run once, pass flag If you are competing on Kaggle, you should do inference outputing a CSV  e.g.naming file as kaggle_solution.csv :then upload my_model.tgz to Kaggle via Team Model Upload
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Train Frame-level model	Train using Evaluate the modelProduce CSV  --output_model_tgz=my_model.tgz.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Downloading the entire dataset	Now that you've downloaded a fraction and the code works, you are all set todownload the entire dataset and come up with the next best video classificationTo download the entire dataset, repeat the above download.py commands, droppingthe shard variable
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Downloading the entire dataset	You can download the video-level training set with:occupying 18GB of space
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Downloading the entire dataset	If you are located outside of North America, you shouldchange the flag 'mirror' to 'eu' for Europe or 'asia' for Asia to speed up thetransfer of the files.Change 'train' to 'validate'/'test' and re-run the command to download theother splits of the dataset
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Downloading the entire dataset	Change 'video' to 'frame' to download theframe-level features
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Downloading the entire dataset	The complete frame-level features take about 1.53TB ofspace
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Downloading the entire dataset	You can set the environment variable 'shard' to 'm,n' to download onlym/n-th of the data.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Tensorboard	You can use Tensorboard to compare your frame-level or video-level models, like:We find it useful to keep the tensorboard instance always running, as we trainand evaluate different models.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	The binaries --train_dir
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	The train.py outputs to --train_dir the  TensorFlow graph aswell as the model checkpoint, as the model is training
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	It will also output aJSON file, model_flags.json, which is used by evaluate.py and inference.pyto setup the model and know what type of data to feed  frame-level VSvideo-level, as determined by the flags passed to train.py .You can specify a model by using the --model flag
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	For example, you canutilize the LogisticModel  the default  by:to represent all of those files.By default, the training code will frequently write _checkpoint_ files  i.e.values of all trainable parameters, at the current training iteration 
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	Thesewill be written to the --train_dir
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	If you re-use a --train_dir, the trainerwill first restore the latest checkpoint written in that directory
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	This onlyworks if the architecture of the checkpoint matches the graph created by thetraining code
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training Details	If you are in active development/debugging phase, consideradding --start_new_model flag to your run configuration.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Evaluation and Inference	Here's how to evaluate a model on the validation dataset:name, the 'training' argument really just offers a cloud hostedpython/tensorflow service
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Evaluation and Inference	From the point of view of the Cloud Platform, thereis no distinction between our training and inference jobs
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Evaluation and Inference	The Cloud ML platformalso offers specialized functionality for prediction withTensorflow models, but discussing that is beyond the scope of this readme.Once these job starts executing you will see outputs similar to thefollowing for the evaluation code:You can browse the storage buckets you created on Google Cloud, for example, toaccess the trained models, prediction CSV files, etc
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Evaluation and Inference	by visiting the Google Cloud storage browser Alternatively, you can use the 'gsutil' command to download the files directly.For example, to download the output of the inference code from the previoussection to your local machine, run:to the 'gcloud' training command given above, and change 'video' in paths to'frame'
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Evaluation and Inference	Here is a sample command to kick-off a frame-level job:logistic model trained over the video-level features
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Evaluation and Inference	Please look at the'video_level_models.py' or 'frame_level_models.py' files to see how to implementyour own models.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Frame-Level Features	Follow the same instructions as above, appending--frame_features=True --model=FrameLevelLogisticModel --feature_names="rgb"--feature_sizes="1024" for train.py and changing --train_dir.The models.py file to see how to implement your own models.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Audio Features	The feature files  both Frame-Level and Video-Level  contain two sets offeatures: 1  visual and 2  audio
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Audio Features	The code defaults to using the visualfeatures only, but it is possible to use audio features instead of  or besides visual features
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Audio Features	To specify the  combination of  features to use you must set--feature_names and --feature_sizes flags
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Audio Features	The visual and audio features arecalled 'rgb' and 'audio' and have 1024 and 128 dimensions, respectively.The two flags take a comma-separated list of values in string
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Audio Features	For example, touse audio-visual Video-Level features the flags must be set as follows:lists provided to the two flags above match
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Audio Features	Also, the order must match whenrunning training, evaluation, or inference.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using GPUs	If your Tensorflow installation has GPU support, this code will make use of allof your compatible GPUs
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using GPUs	You can verify your installation by runningwith the GPUs, whereas the CPU will be used primarily for the input and outputpipelines
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using GPUs	If you have multiple GPUs, the current default behavior is to useonly one of them.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Ground-Truth Label Files	We also provide CSV files containing the ground-truth label information of the'train' and 'validation' partitions of the dataset
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Ground-Truth Label Files	These files can bedownloaded using 'gsutil' command:ground-truth labels corresponding to that video
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Ground-Truth Label Files	For example, for a video withid 'VIDEO_ID' and two labels 'LABEL1' and 'LABEL2' we store the following line:
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training on the Cloud over Video-Level Features	The following commands will train a model on Google Cloudover video-level features.containing the 'train.py' script and more generally the python package whichshould be deployed to the cloud worker
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training on the Cloud over Video-Level Features	The module-name refers to the specificpython script which should be executed  in this case the train module .It may take several minutes before the job starts running on Google Cloud.When it starts you will see outputs like the following:model will continue to train indefinitely in the Cloud
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Training on the Cloud over Video-Level Features	Later, you can checkon its progress or halt the job by visiting the Google Cloud ML Jobs console You can train many jobs at once and use tensorboard to compare their performance  If you are using Google Cloud Shell, you can instead click the Web Preview buttonon the upper left corner of the Cloud Shell window and select "Preview on port 8080".This will bring up a new browser tab with the Tensorboard view.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Larger Machine Types	Some complex frame-level models can take as long as a week to converge whenusing only one GPU
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Larger Machine Types	You can train these models more quickly by using morepowerful machine types which have additional GPUs
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Using Larger Machine Types	To use a configuration with4 GPUs, replace the argument to --config with youtube-8m/cloudml-4gpu.yaml.Be careful with this argument as it will also increase the rate you are chargedby a factor of 4 as well.
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Overview of Models	This sample code contains implementations of the models given in the YouTube-8M technical report 
google-readmegoogle-youtube-8m.md	Create Your Own Dataset Files	You can create your dataset files from your own videos
